<span class="time"><b>August 3rd</b> 10:03 am</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Sorry sorry sorry I did just fall asleep! I was exhausted, and with the kind of emotional bombshell we both dropped on each other I just... completely conked out.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>oh thank god</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>u had me worried</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I'm sorry &gt;&lt;</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you're good dw abt it</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>also good morning</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>how are u feeling</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Like, physically, or emotionally?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>either</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I don't hurt as bad. My magic usually heals me while I'm transformed, but I think even un-transformed it does... something. Just much slower. So I'm still sore, but it's closer to a "spent a whole day at the gym" sore than anything. My cuts and scrapes are all gone as far as I can tell, and my bruises are fading.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>thank god</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you absolutely looked like hell yesterday</span><br />
<span class="text22"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I know :/</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Um. But I did wake up to your texts from last night, and I'm like... wow, how do I explain it? It's like there's this lightness in my chest, and I'm almost afraid to let it stay there because it might go away when I least expect it, but also it's such a nice feeling that I kind of want to let it stay? You're just... so nice, and sweet, and kind and caring even when I'm being like "noo you probably can't love me back."</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>kay. pump the breaks a bit</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I am not ready to use that word. not that way.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i like you a lot. i mean a LOT. and ive absolutely fallen for u. but love is a very strong word and im not ready to say it yet</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Okay. Yeah, that's fair. Okay. How are you feeling about... everything?</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I Dont Know.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>its all a tangled mess in my head and any time i undo one knot, three more appear</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>so heres what i know:</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>1. i like you. a lot. i said that already but im saying it again bc fuck it</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>2. i care abt you so FUCKING much. the idea that ur throwing urself into the mouth of danger and cant stop doing that freaks me the fuck out, but</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>3. i kind of used to do the same thing except very different, so do i really have any room 2 judge u for it? idk. probably not.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>4. i am not ready to let go of u. im not going to stop talking w you or liking u just bc ur some magical girl type thing</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>5. i am severely overwhelmed</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>That all makes sense. I... really don't know how to reply to it, though.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>idk how ur supposed to respond to all that, i was just answering the question</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I guess, for me, my big thing is that you like me back. Like, that seemed so impossible to me. But for you, the big thing is that I'm a Star Guardian. I'm so used to that at this point, but not only are you not used to it, you're very concerned about it. So that's kind of where we're split.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>that sounds abt right</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>how close were u to goin "so... do u wanna b my gf <span class="x1F97A"><span class="hide">(Pleading Face )</span></span><span class="x1F449"><span class="hide">(White Right Pointing Backhand Index ≊ Backhand Index Pointing Right)</span></span><span class="x1F448"><span class="hide">(White Left Pointing Backhand Index ≊ Backhand Index Pointing Left)</span></span>"</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>...You really do know me too well orz</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>LMFAO</span><br />
<span class="text22"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>...I mean... do you?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Do you want to actually date, I mean, not do you actually know me too well.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>yes, BUT</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i am not ready to call us like. girlfriends.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>like i WANT to, lux, dont get it twisted</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i WANT to be your partner, i WANT to call you my girlfriend</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Then why can't we?</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i'm not ready for it yet. which is weird, coming from me, the girl who sprints headlong into every idea shes ever had</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>im not saying no, im saying i need us to give it time first</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>we spent so much time being friends. i need us to spend some time figuring out what "more than friends" feels like for us</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>so like. dating? yes. absolutely. "girlfriend" label? no.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Okay. I get that. I don't like it, but I get it.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>u dated jarvan without bein his girlfriend why is this different</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Because I didn't LOVE Jarvan! I already know I love you!</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>listen just for right now i need you to stop sayin that word</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>please</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>just for now</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Why?!?! It's true!!!</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i know it is, i know it is and i dont like. hate it</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i LIKE hearin it, it makes me like. warm.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but ALSO its trying to send me into fight or flee or w/e thats called</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>it scares me a little</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You're scared of me loving you?</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>no!!!</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>maybe!!!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>idk!!! its a rly strong feeling that feels like its way too soon for!!! its complicated, its all complicated and twisted up in my brain and im tryin to iron it out. okay, i am tryin to iron it out. but every time u say it, it wrinkles everythin again, so please, just for now, pls stop sayin that word. im sorry</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>It's fine. I get it. Again, I don't like it, but I do understand. Just because it feels like we've known each other forever, it doesn't mean we actually have. I'm being hasty and impulsive.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>im sorry. im not saying stop saying it forever. just for now. ok? bc i do like hearing it. but its making it hard to think</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>There's the other elephant in the room. Dating a Star Guardian is going to be... hard.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>ah.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>yes.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>that.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You're the one who isn't used to... any of this yet, and the one who is more hesitant about the whole thing. What are your thoughts?</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i mean i think u have a death wish</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but i also know this is important to you</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>and im not gonna be like 'if were gonna date you have to give that up' even tho i kinda wish i could</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>so like, can't beat em, join em, right? i'll play getaway driver, ill play field medic, whatever u need</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>just. please keep your location on please?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>...Really? That's it? I really felt like there was going to be a lot bigger of an issue there. You're really just... going to be on my side, and help me? That's really dangerous for a civilian. You know that, right?</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>luxie</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I realize you dont know much abt my past</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but 'danger' is kind of my middle name</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Oh, I didn't even think about that. Hahaha, it's kind of funny, you going from destroying things to helping save the world.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>ok, no, do not get it twisted</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i am not doing this to help the world</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>idgaf abt the world</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>im doing it to help YOU.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Okay, yeah, that does make more sense. I'll keep my location on for you, and if you want, I'll even tell you when I'm going out. Um, this is weird to ask, but could you erase these messages after we're done talking about it? I just... I'm a little anxious about all this being in text form. I don't know who could see it eventually and maybe blow my cover...?</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Yea, sure</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>we could make a codeword for when ur goin out, too</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>what abt like... "i have a date?"</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Would that really be okay?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i mean I know better now <span class="x1F61B"><span class="hide">(Face With Stuck-Out Tongue )</span></span></span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I guess that's true :P Yeah, okay. That's probably a good way to tell you.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>ok</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>ok</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>this all feels weird but not completely bad weird. theres some good weird in there. and also probably some 'just need to get used to it' weird</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>We have one more thing to do</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>If we're going to be dating... we need to plan our first date :3</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>OH</span><br />
