<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Is everything okay? Are you mad at me?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Your voicemail is full? Why do I get the feeling you never empty it? :P</span><br />

<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Okay so I know I'm probably being annoying but I can't sleep and I'm worried about you and you either arent reading my messages or turned read receipts off? So I'm kind of worried you're doing something reckless or something you think I'll be upset with you for? You said you weren't feeling well though the time time I talked to you so I'm kind of worried something bad has happened!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I'm rambling, I know I'm rambling, but like, you're my friend, and I wanna know that you're okay, and that we're okay, and just... I don't know.</span><br />
<span class="time"><b>June 30th</b> 7:52 am</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Okay um, I don't know if this is a "take a hint" kind of situation, but I'm REALLY BAD at taking hints, as I'm sure you've noticed!! But I can't tell! If this is a "wow Lux take a hint you're so dense!" situation or if you're in trouble or hurt or something!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>im not in trouble.</span><br />
<span class="readreceipt">Read 7:53 pm</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>...Oh. Um. Well okay then. I guess that answers that. I kind of wish you'd talk to me about whatever's going on, but I guess that's probably too much to hope for, huh?</span><br />
<span class="time"><b>June 30th</b> 1:37 pm</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Is this really it? Just like that, we're not talking? We're not friends? I don't even get to know what happened?</span><br />
<span class="time"><b>June 30th</b> 11:11 pm</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Fuck you, Jinx.</span><br />

<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>What the fuck is your problem!! What did I ever do to you to deserve this!! Were you just pretending to be my friend this whole time? Until you got bored of me? Was everything you said to me a lie, or just some way to keep me hanging on to you?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I was just some toy to you. Another way to people-watch. A way to explore how "interesting humans are" through my eyes. I was right to be guarded, to keep you out, and you still wormed your way in and broke down my walls and made me like you. You made me care about you. You made me think you were my friend. And this whole time, it wast just until something better came along. I hope whoever is your new plaything sees through your whole "I'm a BAD GIRL but I'm REFORMING because of YOU" act and you're left out in the cold. Like you did to me. How dare you. How dare you! How dare you make me feel so stupid, how dare you use me like this! Fuck you. Now that I know the truth, I'm better off.</span><br />

<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Please reply. Even if it's just one word. Or an angry paragraph. Please. I never knew what a "real" friendship felt like until I met you. I don't know what to do without you. It's like a piece of my life is missing. It's like a piece of ME is missing.</span><br />
<span class="time"><b>July 3rd</b> 3:43 am</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Please, Jinx.</span><br />

<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You know what, forget it. You're clearly not going to reply. Why bother hoping for rain in a desert? There are other people around me who love me, who care about me, and who won't ice me out. Maybe you were special to me, but I wasn't special to you. And I deserve to be around people who I AM special to.</span><br />

<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>What did I do wrong?</span><br />
<span class="time"><b>July 7th</b> 11:11 am</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>My wish is you, I guess. Haha, if we were still talking, you'd call me a nerd, or a dweeb, or something. But my 11:11 wish is you.</span><br />

<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You asked about Demacia, a while back. God, it feels like forever since you asked. Demacia is beautiful. Its spires reaching into the sky, its cobblestone roads and the sound of horses hooves against them. It's the bustle in the morning down at the shops - I didn't use to go, since my parents were very "that's what we have maids for, Luxana," but toward the end of the school year I started going out to see Sylas - oh God, I never told you about THAT mess, did I? I digress. I try to go once a week now, though my brother accompanies me most of the time, so it's not like I get to be alone with my thoughts. Maybe that's for the best. It's kind of nice, getting lost in a crowd, but still seeing familiar faces at the stores. There's a cute little bakery one of my school friends works at that we usually stop and get pumpkin bread from, and it's always warm, and has just the right amount of spiciness to it. Um, what else about Demacia... there's the magic ban, obviously. There are some breakthroughs in hextech being done here, but obviously not to the scale of Zaun or Piltover - they're things I'm sure you'd probably scoff at, haha. I actually didn't used to spend a lot of time in Demacia - during the school year, my family actually rents an apartment for me to stay in Valoran City, so I can go to school there. I know, super rich-girl of me, right? But that's sort of almost better, cause Demacia can be kind of stifling. It's very traditional. Valoran City is kind of a melting pot, so it's been nice to get more of an outside perspective. Though, thinking about it, even in school I tend to stay in Demacian circles, which I guess is why I butted heads so much with you at the start.</span><br />

<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You better be taking good care of Crusher.</span><br />
<span class="time"><b>July 9th</b> 11:11 pm</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You haven't even blocked my number. My messages are going through as delivered and still being blue bubbles instead of turning green so I KNOW you haven't blocked me. So what's the deal???? Why aren't you talking to me but for some reason not committing to cutting me off???</span>
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Actually, I get it. I'M cut off from YOU, but YOU'RE not cut off from ME. Because *I* keep TEXTING YOU like an IDIOT. Well, now that I know, I guess that's that. Bye.</span><br />

<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Do you even miss me?</span><br />
