<span class="time"><b>June 22nd</b> 11:07 am</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I have awoken</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>o.o</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>This is still pretty early for you, isn't it?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Eh</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I kinda kept going in and out of sleep after talking to ya this morning</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Gaaaah, I'm so sorry &gt;.&lt; </span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Luxy</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you remember how I literally just do whatever?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>if I didn't wanna reply to you earlier I wouldn't have</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but I did want to! so I did it</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I mean... yeah, that's fair, but I still feel bad about it. </span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>well stop it!!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>anyway, whatre you up to today?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Bleugh. I've been talked into going to a party sort of thing tonight</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>...a what now?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Well it's like... it started out as a friendly get-together, but then certain people heard about it and asked the host if they could come, and the host said yes, and things kind of spiraled from there? Like the venue has completely changed, at least, so the original host doesn't have to suddenly accommodate for all these people, and I really don't want to go, but I already committed back when it was a friendly get-together, and I just... gah, I'm honestly just getting more stressed the more I think about it!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>sloooow your roll there Luxy-Loo</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>If the plans got completely changed, why cant you just meet as a group of friends again</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>and just do the original plan?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Because a couple of the girls from the original get-together would rather do the party ;-;</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>dumb</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>then why can't you just not go?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I can't just ditch!!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>why not!!!!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Because it's... not something I can do. It's something that's socially expected of me.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Even though you don't wanna go</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Even though I don't want to go, yes.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>God I am glad I'm not a socially obligated person!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>My advise for things is always going to be ditch,</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>tell them how you actually feel,</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>or break up with them</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but I have a feeling none of these are helpful to you right now</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but i can talk about it with you if you want</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>That might help? I don't know, I'm just really anxious about it &gt;.&lt; </span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>so is it that its gonna be too many people or what</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>That's... part of it, yeah. I'm really not a fan of large groups of people, but also there's... a few people there I really just... don't want to see! Especially in a social context!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>bad history?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I guess, yeah.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Uuuugh stop beating around the bush with it and tell meeeeeee</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Do you remember when I told you I played the question game once with a boy, and really didn't have a great time?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Ooooohhhhhh</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Yeah, so he'll be there, and unless I can convince Sylas to come so I can use him as boy-repellent, I'm gonna have to deal with THAT, probably all night.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>waitwaitwaitwait</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Sylas is boy repellent?????</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>He's kind of looks rough around the edges. Plus, if you stick close enough to a guy, people tend to think you two are together. That's what you thought too, right?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Still not convinced you two aren't SOMETHING...</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span><span class="x1F60F"><span class="hide">(Smirking Face )</span></span></span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Hush, you.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Does HE know you two aren't together?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Jinx please omg</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>is that a no?</span><br />
<span class="time"><b>June 22nd</b> 1:29 pm</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>It's IMPLIED. He's a friend who is a guy, that doesn't mean it has to become romantic. There's not even any real chemistry between us.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>ooh, any REAL chemistry?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>does that mean you're trying to MAKE chemistry between you two?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Jinx PLEASE</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Well?????</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Maybe I was at one point, but I realized a while ago that what he wants out of life and what I want are vastly different things. So I'm over it.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>are you though?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Shhhhhhhhhhh</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>OMG LUX!!!!!!!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>do you still have a crush on him!!!!!!!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Do you ever really stop having a crush on someone?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>one time I thought I had a crush on a boy and then I realized I didn't like boys</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>does that count?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I... no? I have no idea if that counts actually.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>can we say it counts so I can one-up you</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Oh, if we MUST. :P</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Pfft, you're already Princess Perfecto, let me have this one <span class="x1F61B"><span class="hide">(Face With Stuck-Out Tongue )</span></span></span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Can I ask something kind of awkward?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I'm gay</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>which is directly related to why I'm a heathen, yes. <span class="x1F61B"><span class="hide">(Face With Stuck-Out Tongue )</span></span></span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>does that answer it?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Only like, partly. Also you're a heathen because you're an agent of chaos, not because you're gay. :P Anyway, how did you like... know, I guess?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>god I hate this question</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Don't worry about it then!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Lux</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>how did you know your hair was pink?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Um... I... looked in the mirror?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but ok like</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>when did you become AWARE it was pink</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I... don't know what you're asking.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>there wasn't really a time that you realized, like</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>"oh, my hair is pink", right?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>it was more like just, something that you didn't think about until it was relevant, right?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>...Yeah. Yeah, I think I get what you're saying.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>that's what it was for me.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I have no idea when I "knew" I was gay</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>cause like I don't remember a time I didn't like girls</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>and it only became apparent that I didn't like boys when I thought I had a crush on one</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but then I realized I DIDN'T have a crush on him,</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>HE just had a crush on ME,</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>and I thought because I liked him as a friend that was the same as having a crush on him too</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>and that uh, didn't go so hot</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>just somethin else for me to destroy!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>so uh yeah</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Oh wow, Jinx, I'm really sorry.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>eh</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I don't worry about what's behind me</span><br />
<span class="time"><b>June 22nd</b> 3:42 pm</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I guess the reason I ask is like... it's... something I've thought about but not a lot...? And I haven't had a chance to really talk to anyone who is gay to like... I don't know. Sorry, I don't wanna dump this random baggage on you </span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Pffffffffffffffffft</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I just dumped random baggage on YOU ya goon</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>and I really don't care</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You're sure?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>if I don't feel like answering I just wont lol</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but it's not really a sensitive topic for me!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I just like... I know I like boys.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Disgusting. Continue.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I... god this is so embarrassing, but I've always... thought... of girls... like that...? And I thought, you know, all girls think like this.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Sure, Lux.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>All girls fantasize about being another girl pinning them to a wall and teasing them endlessly. <span class="x1F60F"><span class="hide">(Smirking Face )</span></span></span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>AAAAAAAAAAAAA GOD JINX DONT JUST SAY THAT!!!!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>OMG NAIL ON HEAD YOU ARE A BOTTOM!!!!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>STOP OH MY GOD</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but yeah no straight girls don't think about that kind of thing LOL</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>So then what the heck! Does that make me bi? Or something? It's not something I've really thought that much about?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>hell if I know man</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>that is not my call to make</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>sleep on it for a while and when you know, you know</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>and if you don't thats fine too</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I personally wouldn't care to even use the gay label if it wasn't so obvious and easy</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>and I am going to take the high road and not make a joke with that statement</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>How mature of you :P</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I just... I don't know. I feel kind of stupid, I guess.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>nah you're not stupid</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>no more stupid than me anyway</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but to be fair I can be pretty stupid</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>so I'm not sure what that says about you!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Oh hush you!!! You're not stupid. Just... impulsive.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Isn't that just a nice way of saying "makes stupid choices really quickly"</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Okay, yeah, it is.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Anyway, bright side!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Maaaaybe there will be some cute girls at this party?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>...Eep. I... don't think I'm ready to try and process this whole thing =_=;; </span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>first of all, lame</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but second of all, valid</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but THIRD of all, if you find a girl to cling to, maybe that random guy won't bug you?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Mm... doubtful. He's the kind of person whose confidence stems from obliviousness. I'm pretty sure I could be hanging all over a girl and he'd assume she was like, my sister or something.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>So he's an idiot.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>More or less.</span><br />

<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>just tell him off!!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>oh wait hang on</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I cant!!!!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you can't</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>yeah there it is</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>He's annoying, but he can't help that he has feelings for me. And I'm just... not good at being mean.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Ooh! Me! Pick me!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I'm REALLY GOOD at being mean</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>let me do it please please please please please</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Jinx no</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Jinx YES</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Just tell me where this party is and not only will I tell him off,</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I will ALSO hang all over you and act like a trashy, jealous girlfriend and glare at him from across the room any time he so much as glances at your shoes</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Jinx NO</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>You are absolutely no fun</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Are you sure your trashy, jealous girlfriend act is just an act? Maybe deep down, that's just part of your chaotic nature. :P</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Wanna find out? <span class="x1F61B"><span class="hide">(Face With Stuck-Out Tongue )</span></span></span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Ha ha.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Anyway, NO, I'm not the trashy jealous girlfriend.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I'm the crazy, trashy girlfriend</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I thought that much would be obvious</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Oh, of course, my mistake. :P</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Honestly Lux, it's like you don't know me!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Won't happen again, I promise</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Anyway, you're a big girl</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I'm sure you'll be fine tonight</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>;-;</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I'm just really not good in large groups!!! I can do a tight-knit group of friends, but anything larger and I start getting really awkward. And anxious. I'm just not cut out for it!!! And I just know I'm going to do something to make myself look like an idiot in front of all of these people.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>it doesnt matter though!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>everything is fake and we live on a rock hurtling through space!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>who cares if you mess up saying hello!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>or spill cheap beer on your shoes!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>or some bitchy girl side-eyes you!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>the only thing that matters is that you enjoy yourself!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>this has been life advise with Jinx.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I mean I get where you're coming from but it's hard to agree with it when my entire life has been focused around maintaining my own and my family's image!!!</span><br />

<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>well</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>if it comes down to it</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I can call you and pretend to be your cousin or something and tell you you have to come home right now</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>and I don't offer that to just anyone!!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>So don't make me regret it</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Awwww, Jinx!!!! You're sweet. I'll only take you up on that if I really really need it. I'm... I'll try to have a good time anyway. My friends will be there, so it's not like I'll really be alone. I'm just overthinking it. Please don't worry about me, okay?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Luxy, you worry enough for both of us</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You're probably right. :P I should probably start getting ready, my ride is going to be here soon.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Not that I know anything about parties, but isn't this kind of early?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>She and I are going out for coffee before the party, it's been a while since we've been able to spend time together.</span><br />
