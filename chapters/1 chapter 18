<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>It's going really well! He's really nice, and not bad to look at. I mean, he's no boy-band hottie. :P But he's normal-boy hot.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you mean i WONT get to rub it in ur face that he's a douche?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>dammit.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Oh come on :P I'm just happy I'm not suffering through with a smile. I was half expecting to have to. Some of my brother's friends are so...</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Dumb?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I... wouldn't put it THAT way. They can be goal-oriented, but boring because of it. It's all they're ever really focused on, overall. So I'm kind of relieved this guy has a personality, haha!</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>haha</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>well thats good then!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you're enjoying yourself?</span><br />
<span class="text22"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Yes! He's been nothing but a gentleman so far, asking me about things I'm interested and what I'm hoping to do after high school... He'll be a senior this year, so he's two years ahead of me, and he's planning to go off to college. I told him I'm not really sure yet, and I'm exploring my options. i kind of expected him to push it beyond that - my brother has been trying to get me to commit to a college, so maybe this was all a ploy to get me to at least consider a few schools, but he totally dropped it after that. It was... kind of refreshing, actually.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Ah, he's coming back from getting our food, I'll talk to you later!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>have fun</span><br />

<span class="text22"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Aaaah, I had such a good time!! He was a total gentleman, and really nice to talk to. Lunch was delicious, the weather was beautiful, I couldn't have asked for a better first date!</span><br />
