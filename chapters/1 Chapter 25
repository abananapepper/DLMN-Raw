<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>okay so i dont wanna like. push.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but its been a few days since i've heard from you and i wanted to make sure everything was okay</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Yes! Sorry, I've been getting ready for school to start up again, and it's just been this whole thing... Junior year, y'know, my parents are expecting me to do really well on entrance exams on top of everything else I usually juggle during the school year.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>for real? you know you're gonna like, knock it out of the park, right? wherever you wanna go, i'm sure you're a shoe-in</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I can't rest on my laurels, unfortunately. This is something I have to keep working for if I want to make sure I get into my first, or even second or third, choice.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>where do you wanna go?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>... I don't even know (×_×;) There's so much I want to learn and do, and my parents have very specific expectations for me, and most of the schools on my list don't exactly line up with their list, and theirs don't line up with my list, and I'm not even super sure I want to go to university at all, but also, it's all I've ever known is to study to better myself... it's a lot. I've been trying not to think about it ^^;</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Oh damn Lux, that's. That's a lot, I'm sorry.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i know you, and i know u'll get through this just fine</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but im sorry you have to, y'know?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Yeah, thank you, I appreciate it. I get the "if anyone can do it, it's you!" a lot, but it really does start feeling like... I'm tired. You know? I'm tired of *having* to. I kind of wish I could just take a break and not lead the pack once in a while, or even need to keep up with everyone. Just... once in a while</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>it gets heavy</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>being expected to be the shiniest person on the room gets heavy</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You have no idea orz</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>heh</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>maybe</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but i'm here if you need anything. You know that, right?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Even if it's just to rant and rave about how unfair and stupid life is right now</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I do. Thank you. I forget sometimes that I don't have to be Luxanna around you the way I do with others. I mean, my friends are great, and I guess I don't have to be "Luxanna" to them, but I'm somewhere between "Luxanna" and "Lux" with them. Or at least the version of Lux you get to see.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>aww, i'm special??</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I'm flattered, girlie</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i'd like to thank the academy, one specific pizza delivery girl, Crusher...</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Oh hush, you :P</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>What're you up to right now anyway?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Besides Stressing over Everything</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Cleaning my room. I've been letting it go, and it's finally getting to me. I've found that if my room gets too cluttered, it makes me more anxious, as silly as that sounds.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>nah i dont think thats silly</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i'm the same way about my workshop tbh</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Really?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>really!!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Don't take this the wrong way, but I always assumed you were more of a messy, cluttered person</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>oh i am by most peoples standards</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but i have a system</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i know where everything is even if its a huge fucking mess to normal eyes</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>at one point i had a shared workspace and the guy i was sharing with tried to "organize" all my shit, and i couldn't find ANYTHING for THREE DAYS</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i about tore my hair out, i thought i was going crazy</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>well</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>craziER</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I really don't think you're as crazy as you let people believe you are, to be honest!</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i've been able to tone it back recently tbh</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>it ebbs and flows</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Even so, when you were at your most... abrasive, with me, I think you just had a lot of walls up. Which, like, I don't blame you, I was a complete stranger and then also a huge bitch</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>ugh, yas says the same thing</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>about the walls i mean</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>not abt you being a bitch</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>which you aren't, for the record</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I was. I can be. I'm very good at being cold and closed off and hideously fake. But that's also a "walls" thing for me, too. We all have our defenses, right?</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i mean you're right but</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>idk</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i feel like i still have the ability to just. be absolutely batshit at any point. like it'll creep up on me maybe</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Maybe. I can only tell you what I've seen, and what conclusions I can draw from my own life experiences, so take it with a grain of salt ^^</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>nah like</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you might be onto something maybe</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but i dont like thinking about it! so i'm not gonna</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You don't have to! It was just something I noticed.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you're good at that!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>noticing things, i mean</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Only sometimes. A lot of times I don't notice things going on right past the end of my nose. It's usually easier for me to notice things going on with other people than myself, though, so that may be part of it</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>oh?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>?</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>that seems odd to me, idk</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i think i'm better at noticing things going on w myself than others</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>like, acutely, keenly aware of myself at all times. its a curse honestly!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Let's split the difference - I'll give you some of my awareness of others, and you give me some of your awareness of self, how about?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I don't think that would work. You'd just be twice as aware of me since I'm giving you awareness of Me, and also, I'd be twice as aware of me since you're giving me awareness of people who are Not You <span class="x1F61B"><span class="hide">(Face With Stuck-Out Tongue )</span></span></span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Hmm, is that how that would work?</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>prolly</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>nothing ever happens or works the way u think it will</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Hmm, true.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>which is why! i have ever confidence in u and the situation you're in right now</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>because YOU are expecting everything to go wrong somehow</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>right?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>...Yeah...</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>BUT</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>if nothing EVER goes EXACTLY the way you expect</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>then it wont be as horrible firebomb ugly disaster as you think!</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>and i mean some things do go to plan right, but like</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>never exactly. theres always something different than how u imagined. sometimes its little, sometimes its big</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>sometimes its something you do, and you surprise yourself!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>not that i'd know, of course. i never act out of character</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Uh-huh. Something tells me that is a bold-faced lie, just based on our history together :3</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I'm sure I have no idea what you mean!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Changing the subject completely, can I ask you a question?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Fire away, chika!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>This might be awkward, but how do you like... tell someone you like them? I've never had to do it before, it's always been people approaching me.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>brag away, little miss popular</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>tbh idek honestly!!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i don't think i'd be where i am if i knew how to tell people shit like that</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>What do you mean?</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>dw about it</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>my point is that i am the exact WRONG person to ask that in every sense of the word</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Have you just never had a crush on someone???</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>no lmao omg, of course i have!!</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i've just never like, acted on it</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>ur probably better off asking one of your school friends, yknow?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I can't</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>????</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>It's... complicated</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>oh. oohhhh</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>u have a crush on one of ur friends but also don't want the rumor to spread?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>or dont wanna out yrself</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Something like that, yeah &gt;&lt;</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>oof.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Yeah. Sorry, forget I said anything about it.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>nah ur good!! i just like. dont actually have any advice to give</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i'm more of a "pine from a distance" kinda bitch</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Really? That kind of surprises me</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i'm full of surprises today!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You just seem like the "go get what you want" kind of person. Once you know what you want, anyway :P</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>ehh. It depends. like on one hand yeah i very much am when it comes to like. things, events, shit like that, i try and get what i want and make what i wanna happen happen</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but like, i'm still fairly new at the whole... maintaining personal relations thing. not even just with you</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>tbh i only started calling my friends "my friends" kinda recently, before they were just people i knew and tolerated</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>tbh i only started calling my friends "my friends" kinda recently, before they were just people i knew and tolerated</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>actually i mighta called them "my friends" but like, i didnt mean it. i used the term real loosely</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Do I make the cut for that list of friends of yours?</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>DUH</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Luxy you were one of the first people i categorized as my actual friend</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Lux</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Dammit</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>sorry</span><br />
<span class="text22"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>No worries ^^ </span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You really are full of surprises today. Considering how we started out, I'm amazed I was one of the first people you thought of as a real friend, you know? Looking back, I'm not sure I deserve that.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Don't start that</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Huh?</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>That self-hating spiral. don't u start.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I get to decide who is my friend, and why, and when. theres no "deserve" or "worthy"</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>god the idea of someone needing to be "worthy" of MY friendship? gag</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>C'mon, I know you aren't friendly to just anyone</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>exactly, and so you're not just anyone!!</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>So dont let yourself think you;re "just anyone"</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>especially not to me</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>okay?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>...Okay. Yeah, okay. That makes sense. It's just hard to wrap my head around, I guess.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>why?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I don't know. Just a feeling.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>what's the feeling?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>talk 2 me, girlie</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I guess... I feel both special and replaceable. In general, not just to you. And that's why I have to work so hard to excel, so that I'm not replaced. Like, sure, I'm this gifted kid in more ways than one, but I always worry that if I step a toe out of line, I'll be tossed out. It's kind of been the background radiation of my life. I... I can't explain too much, because it starts getting into the stuff I'm not allowed to talk about. The secret stuff.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>god thats frustrating</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I'm sorry</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>no, i'm not mad at you, im just. i wish i knew everything that was going on so i could really help with it. its not ur fault u cant tell me</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i know better than to pretend i know what the rest of your life is like but</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you're not replaceable to me. i mean it.</span><br />
<span class="text22"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>That... actually means more than you could possibly know, Jinx. Thank you. &lt;3</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>And in case it needs to be said, the feeling is mutual, of course. There's no one else like you, and I don't think I could ever find someone who fits the space you occupy in my life. Trust me, I tried when you left :P</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>heh</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>thanks Lux</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I'm actually touched</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Of course!! Of course of course of course. You're an important person, Jinx, and for all the hyping up you do for me, reminding me that I'm a worthwhile person, you deserve nothing less in return. So don't you get all self-deprecating either? Especially not quietly, I know you don't tell me everything that goes on in that mind of yours</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I am an open book!!!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You're an open book when ASKED. I have a feeling there's a lot of things you keep to yourself, right?</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>. . .</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you know too much about me, I've decided</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I can't stop laughing</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you're trouble, you</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You're one to talk</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>ah, fuck</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i was a bad influence on you wasnt i</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>smh my head</span><br />

<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Something like that :P</span><br />
