<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Can we talk?</span><br />
<span class="time"><b>June 20th</b> 8:18 pm</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Please don't ignore me.</span><br />
<span class="time"><b>June 20th</b> 9:00 pm</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Okay, you have every right to ignore me. But I really would like to talk about what happened, to try and clear the air.</span><br />
<span class="time"><b>June 20th</b> 9:59 pm</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I'm just going to talk then, and get this all out there, cause I know if I sit on these feelings it'll eat away at me.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You don't have to even read it, I guess, but it would be nice to have some closure on this whole thing.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Ok. So. I'm sorry for the way I behaved the other day. I offer no excuse for it. You were pretty on-the-nose with your analysis of me, and it made me feel uncomfortable. I am, paradoxically, both very aware of and blissfully ignorant to the fact I am the youngest of a prestigious family, and the trials and comforts that affords me. The way you phrased things made me feel like the bad guy, though going back and reading the conversation it was clear that I was making you uncomfortable, which is why you reacted the way you did.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>When we were arguing, I deflected your points in order to try and turn the fight in my favor. I felt like I couldn't afford to be wrong, though I know really I had very little to lose by admitting my faults to you, a total stranger. It really was more of an ego problem than anything, I guess. </span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I... have a lot going on in my life right now. Not to suggest that you dont. I'm just under a lot of stress from a lot of sides, and that fed into my outburst. This does't excuse my actions, of course.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Anyway, I just wanted to apologize. If you did read this, thank you. And um... I really enjoy talking to you, despite all evidence to the contrary. You're someone I can be candid around, and that's not something I'm able to be around pretty much anyone. And you don't baby me, which is probably good for me. So I hope we can patch this up, but if we can't, I'll understand.</span><br />

<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I think you're the first person to ever apologize to me</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>So I appreciate that</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>and I should apologize too because I kind of super fueled the flames of that fight</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>like I had this little voice in the back of my head just telling me to walk away</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but I didn't</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>and made it worse</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>and can I be honest with you?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>at the time i kind of got a kick out of it</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>cause thats like</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>my thing</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>destroying things without a second thought</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but then I started to feel like? bad? about it? which is new</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I felt like, bad for making you even more upset, and felt bad that I may have ruined... whatever it is we have here</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I don't even have a fancy explanation like you as to why I did it</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I've been told I'm "chaotic by nature"</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I just like to make a mess of things</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>But this was the first mess I'd ever felt like... bad about.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>So I'm sorry too</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>and thank you for texting me about it cause honestly I was just gonna let it go</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>cause I don't know how to start an... apology conversation, cause I've never had one</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I accept your apology. ^^</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>We're good?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>We're good. Friends?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Yeah</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Yeah!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Friends!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Lummy, I think this is the first time you've called us friends.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Well, we are friends now. We were friends before, probably, but I was too... cagey about it. Too worried, I guess.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Too up your own ass?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Maybe a little, yes. Anyway, now that we're actually calling this a friendship, my name is Lux.</span><br />

<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I am honored, milady Lux.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Ew, don't call me that. It's a nickname people close to me call me. So no one puts "milady" in front of it, and it's especially weird coming from you.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>You mean to tell me you gave me your not-actual-name again?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>jk I don't care</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I'm Jinx!<span class="x1F608"><span class="hide">(Smiling Face With Horns )</span></span></span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Is that short for anything?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>yeah</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>it's short for "my name is Jinx"</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Smart-ass</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>takes one to know one!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You're right. You are right.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I'm always right, Luxy.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Alright, alright, don't push it</span><br />

<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I should get to bed, it's pretty late for me.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Boo! Stay up with me!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Would I could</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Why don't you then!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>It's a secret!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>BOOOOO</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Well, alright then</span><br />
