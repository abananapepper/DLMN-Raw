<span class="time"><b>July 30th</b> 8:01 am</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>I did notice you were online until around 4 am last night. Please tell me you were just having a very long breakup call.</span><br />
<span class="greply"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>How many times am I going to tell you, we are just friends. There's nothing there between us.</span><br />
<span class="text22"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>I do not believe that for a second. You cannot see yourself when you talk about her. I can, and do. But either way, you can have friend breakups too. So again, I'm going to ask - did you finally cut ties last night?</span><br />
<span class="text22"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>Lux.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>Lux, I know you're ignoring me.</span><br />
<span class="greply"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>[Automated reply] I'm driving right now, I'll text you later!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>You're not helping your case whatsoever, you realize.</span><br />
<span class="time"><b>July 30th</b> 11:27 am</span><br />
<span class="greply"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I didn't cut her off last night. I had no plans to, even after we talked about it. I know that's not what you wanted to hear, but it's the truth, and I'm not about to lie to you about it.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>If I may speak plainly, you're the dumbest bitch I've ever known.</span><br />
<span class="greply"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>...Okay, ouch.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>I want you to remind yourself just how much she hurt you. How long it took for you to be okay again after she left. And you're just letting yourself fall back into step with her like it's nothing.</span><br />
<span class="greply"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I am not just "falling back into step" with her! We're not the same as we were back before she hurt me. And yes, I know she hurt me, I remember it very clearly. We will never really be able to go back to how it was before then. I know that.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>Do you?</span><br />
<span class="greply"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Yes, I do. And I'm setting down boundaries to keep things from getting to where they were before.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>I suppose that's not nothing. I'm just worried about you. Even after she did what she did you to, you still talk about her like personally hangs the stars each night.</span><br />
<span class="greply"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I do NOT!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>Are you aware of that trend where you record yourself talking about a person, put it on 3x speed, and watch it back, to see how you really feel about a person?</span><br />
<span class="greply"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Yes...</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>You might try it sometime. </span><br />
<span class="greply"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I do not have a crush on Jinx, Sona.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>You keep saying that, and I think you're trying to convince yourself more than you are me. May I tell you something else I'm concerned about?</span><br />
<span class="greply"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Yes</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>I'm happy that you are discovering who you are as a person, and that you are becoming more comfortable with your sexuality. To put it frankly, the closet was made of glass. But Jinx was the first girl to show you positive attention while you were realizing you weren't straight. I fear that the reason you're so attached to her is because of the timing of it all - you realized you like girls, and there she was, a girl who you knew liked girls; someone new, someone "safe", relatively speaking, as you didn't have a long history with her. If things went wrong, it would be easier for you to cut her out of your life than someone who has known you longer, like me or Soraka. I know you are not the kind of person to throw others away without your morals or kindness or nature being pushed to it's absolute limit. Sylas was a prime indicator of this. I'm not claiming it would be easy to cut things off with Jinx should you decide it's no longer "safe". But it gives me pause, and I think it's something you should think about.</span><br />
<span class="greply"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I... I'm sorry, I want to make sure I'm reading this right. You think I'm attached to Jinx because we're both gay??</span><br />
<span class="text22"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>That's a vast over-simplification of what I just said, and you know it.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>You're being obtuse on purpose, and I don't appreciate it.</span><br />
<span class="greply"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I just don't understand what you want me to take away from this conversation.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>What is it about this girl that keeps you close to her? Tell me. Tell me, so I can understand.</span><br />
<span class="greply"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>So you can keep picking me and her apart?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>I'm not angry at you, Lux. I really want to understand. If you need, take some time away from this conversation to cool down and come back when you're less upset, that's okay.</span><br />
<span class="greply"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Talking to you is what's making me upset!!!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>I'm sorry.</span><br />
<span class="greply"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Thank you.</span><br />
<span class="time"><b>July 30th</b> 3:21 pm</span><br />
<span class="greply"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I'm sorry, too. I know you have my best interest at heart, and I did grossly oversimplify your concerns. While you make good points, I don't think they apply. I was friends with Jinx before I started really realizing I was bi.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>I accept your apology. Are you able to tell me why you're so attached to her?</span><br />
<span class="greply"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I can't really put it into words, but I'll try. Give me a few moments?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>Of course &lt;3</span><br />
<span class="greply1"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Jinx... didn't know who I was to start, and so she sees me, not my name. She always has. I'm not saying you or Roki or anyone do, but you probably knew my family's name before you knew me. She makes me feel different. Like I don't have to be someone specific with her. There are more walls now than before - there have to be, to keep both of us safe - but even the walls have like, windows. I don't know. When I'm talking with her, it's like... the world is a little bit clearer. And don't get me wrong, she's crazy and destructive and SELF-destructive and nosy as fuck, she's all hard edges and spikes until she's suddenly soft and warm, she's so BRIGHT and knows so much and there's just... there's so much to her, I know there is, she pretends she's this one-note disaster, and every time she shows me a new facet of her I'm more endeared to her. There's so much we've learned from each other, and can keep learning from each other. Even when I'm angry or frustrated with her, getting a text from her makes me...</span><br />
<span class="greply"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>oh. oh fuck.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>Yes?</span><br />
<span class="greply"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Nonononono no no no no no Sona no no no NO no no</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>Have you figured it out?</span><br />
<span class="greply"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I can't. Have a crush on Jinx. I can't. I cant! I can't have a crush!! on Jinx!!!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>But you do. I've been telling you this.</span><br />
<span class="greply"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I'm having a breakdown. This cannot be happening. She's the very very very last person I can fall for.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>Take a deep breath. Talk through it with me.</span><br />
<span class="greply"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I can't have a crush on her. I can't! Because you're right, on some level, she's bad for me. And I'm so scared I'll get hurt again, even if I put on a brave face about it. And like, she doesn't have feelings for me anyway. She play-flirts but like, that's just how she is! That's just her personality. And my parents... god, I'm getting a headache just thinking about it. I can't do this. This can't be happening.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>It's going to be okay. What's the phrase? "This too shall pass"?</span><br />
<span class="greply"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I don't even know how I'm going to talk to her now. Oh my god. How do I act normal around her now? Now that I like... know?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>Is this a good enough reason to stop talking to her altogether?</span><br />
<span class="greply1"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>No. Oh god, the thought of that alone opened up a pit in my stomach. I feel like I'm going to be sick.</span><br />
<span class="greply"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I hate everything about this. Every last thing. So much makes more sense now looking back, but it complicates so much. Why did this have to happen? Why couldn't things just stay the same?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>Entropy is the natural state of the universe. It's going to be okay. Do you remember when you first applied for Hoshi High? You worked yourself into a tizzy over the application, and then when you were accepted, you told me "this is almost worse" because you were stressed about what Hoshi High would be like. But you got through it, and now it comes naturally to you. This will be more of the same. I know it's scary now, but feelings ebb and flow and fade with time. If you want to ignore this, you can.</span><br />
<span class="greply"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I don't know what I want.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>You don't have to know now. This is a lot to process, I know.</span><br />
<span class="greply"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I do need to know. If I'm going to keep talking to her, I do need to know.</span><br />
<span class="text22"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>Why? If you don't think she likes you, how does that change things?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>May I say something that may be hard to hear?</span><br />
<span class="greply"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Yes</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>You said she doesn't have feelings for you. Even if you wanted a relationship with her, if she doesn't reciprocate, it's a moot point.</span><br />
<span class="greply1"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You're right, that was hard to hear. But you're not wrong. I wish you were.</span><br />
<span class="greply"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Effectively, nothing has changed. What she doesn't know won't hurt her. I just have to figure out how to act like I don't like her like that. Even if it kills me, which, I really think it might.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>You have gone through far worse than this, my dear. This will not kill you. It will just hurt for a little while if you do decide you want to keep talking to her. Which, I must again stress, I think is a bad idea regardless of how you feel about her.</span><br />
<span class="greply"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Yes, thank you, you've continually made that clear. But this isn't your decision to make, and while I value your input, you'll forgive me if I don't agree with or follow your advice.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>I just don't want to see you hurt like that again, Lux. I will always be here to help pick up the pieces, but I do not want to have to.</span><br />
<span class="greply1"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I know.</span><br />
<span class="greply"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Thank you for being my friend, Sona. I know it's a bit of a thankless task sometimes.</span><br />
<span class="text22"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>It is not even a task, Lux. We may not always see eye to eye, but I wouldn't be having these conversations with you if I didn't care for you. Friendship with you is not as difficult as you like to make yourself believe. *Loving* you is not as difficult as you like to make yourself believe. I hope someday you can see that.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>Everything is going to be okay, even if it doesn't seem like it now. Things change. Sometimes for better, sometimes for worse, but nothing stays the same for long.</span><br />
<span class="greply"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I know. Thank you.</span><br />
<span class="text22"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>Of course &lt;3</span>
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>Do you want some time alone, or would you like to get out and do something? Some of the girls from the Music Appreciation Club are going to Cafe Nocti tonight, and I'm sure they would love to have you along. It's been a while since they've seen you.</span><br />
<span class="greply"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>That sounds like a good idea. If I stay by myself in my room, my brain is going to eat itself. What time are we meeting?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Sona:</b></span>I'll pick you up in 45 minutes.</span><br />
