<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I kind of expected you to not reply, i think</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>especially since it took you so long to reply</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>not that you like</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>owed me a reply or anything</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>oh you are ignoring me now arent you</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i mean thats</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>to be expected</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>its been like</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>over a month since we talked i think?</span><br />
<span class="text22"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>More or less.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Where the fuck have you been?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>...moping.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>MOPING?</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>YES I'm sorry okay</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I feel so stupid over it and then like</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>so much time passed that like</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>figuring out how to start this conversation was hard</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>So you went with "hey"? Not "sorry" or "can we talk" or literally anything else?</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I mean it worked rite</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you replied, and we're talking</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I almost didn't.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>...why did you?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Because I wanted to finally be able to get any kind of closure between us. Because I want this chapter of my life to be over, and god knows that if I don't get this over with now, it'll always haunt me.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>ah</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>so its so you can yell at me and then dip</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i deserve that</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>fire away</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>No, that's not it, you idiot. It's so that I can finally get answers to my questions, so we can finally call this the end and both move on with our lives. Except, I thought I had moved on. I thought I'd healed. Until you texted me out of the blue and I completely lost it. So really, why? Why bother coming back? Why bother even trying to pretend you didn't make an absolute mess?</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>ugh do you want the truth?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I DESERVE the truth.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>because i knew what i did was wrong, and because you deserved better</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>and because i missed you</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I need a minute.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>ok</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You MISSED me? I tore myself apart wondering what I did wrong, how I could get you back into my life, if I ever actually meant anything to you, and you have the audacity to say you MISSED me? You don't get to miss me, Jinx. After everything you put me through? You don't get to miss any part of me. How dare you.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i know</span><br />
<span class="text22"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>No, you DON'T!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You don't know ANYTHING, because you weren't THERE. I got so used to you being there, so used to you being the person who actually knew me, who actually listened to me, and you weren't there. So you don't know anything. You don't know what I went through, you have no idea how much hurt I trudged through. You don't know a single thing.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i know</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i mean</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i dont know</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>and i dont understand and i never will</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but i hear you</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>and im sorry</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Why? Why did you do it?</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i...</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>dont want to answer that</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Of course you don't. You don't want to have to try and explain your chaos. You don't want to have to own up to your destruction again.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>that's not it, Lux.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Isn't it?</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>It's not!</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>look</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you have every right to be mad at me</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>and to make me out to be the villain i am</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but i didn't leave because you were expendable, or because i was just causing chaos, or because i didnt care about you.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Do you actually believe the things you're saying?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>YES.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Unbelievable.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Why would I lie to you??</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I don't know, Jinx! Why do you do anything you do? Why do you purposely hurt people? Why did you completely abandon me without so much as word for a month? Why would you bother telling me the truth now?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>what do I have to gain by lying to you????</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>What did you have to gain by completely ghosting me?!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Peace of mind knowing we couldn't hurt each other!!!!</span><br />

<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Yes, really!!!! Jarvan and I had a couple of dates but we didn't really click. I mean, they were fun, and he's fun to be around, but we're on completely different wavelengths, so we kind of mutually decided to stop seeing each other.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>. . .</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Why am I even telling you this!!! Why is it so stupidly easy to go back to talking to you like normal!! Like nothing happened!!

<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You... you owe me. For all the time you left me by myself. Please come back.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>im here</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>sorry, phone was on silent</span><br />

<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>not that its my place to ask</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you just sound... really sad. and distressed.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I... I missed you so much. In all that time you were gone, I missed you so much that I felt stupid. It felt like a part of me had been yanked out. God, I felt so stupid. I hardly know you, we hardly know each other... but you were my best friend. ARE my best friend. I can't just let you leave again. Please don't go. Please stay, Jinx.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i... i don't wanna go, Lux</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i DIDNT wanna go</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but i dont wanna hurt you again</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>and i dont... wanna... BE hurt</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I don't want either to happen either. </span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>so like... maybe its for the best that we. dont.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I... am willing to trust you. That you'll talk to me before doing something like this again. Because I think you learned that you're not as great at reading people as you'd like to think. And... if something I do does hurt you, I hope you'll tell me before cutting me off.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>we're both in agreement that this is like</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>a bad idea</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>right</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>What do you mean?</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>im majorly unstable and u have abandonment issues 2 say the least, for one thing</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>er</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>two things</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I hate that you're actually thinking this through for once.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>rude</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i think through plenty</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i usually just get bored of that and stop halfway through</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I guess we don't have to keep this up if you won't want. If you think it's a bad idea.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>oh no i am absolutely not voting to not keep this up</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span> I just wanna make sure we're both clear that this is probably a mistake happening in real-time</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but cmon how many mistakes have u let yourself make in ur sheltered honor student life</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I really don't think you need to play devils advocate here, Jinx. ^_^;; You're okay with it?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i've made my fair share of bad decisions in my life, what's one more between friends? :P</span><br />
