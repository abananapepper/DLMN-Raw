<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I mean... yeah, that's fair, I jsut dont wanna stoop to his level.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you couldn't stoop to his level if you were on your knees and he was on a step stool</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>anyway THIRD of all I'm sorry your not-fight-club meeting was shit</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>is it usually like, a fun thing?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I... that is a loaded question, actually.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>so no</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Well, I mean... some parts of it are fun. Most of it isn't, though. It's really stressful at times.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>maybe take a page out of my book and just</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>stop then</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>if it's not fun don't do it</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>It's not that easy. I wish it was. It's my responsibility. And it's not something I can just... quit. I've thought about trying, a couple times. But I just... can't.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>ok but why not</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>It's... god, okay, how do I explain this... It's something bigger than me.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>is it... a fight club benefiting environment bullshit..??????</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>OH my god. I needed that laugh, thank you.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>OKAY BUT I'M SERIOUS</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>WHAT TF IS IT I'm wracknig my brain but can't think of anything????</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Pass.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>OH ugh its one of your secret things</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>okay well</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>who died and made whoever it is forcing you to stay in this thing king</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you're a human you have free will</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I know. It's never really felt like I DIDN'T have free will in this situation. Just more like... I have to make sacrifices for a higher cause. For the good of more than just me. And sometimes that weight gets a little heavy to carry.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>so set it down</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>don't throw it away just like. idk put it down.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>come back to it. pick it back up when you're ready idk</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I wish I could. There's no one to hold it while I take a break from it.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>HOW DO YOU FIGHT CLUB BY YOURSELF</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>OH MY GOD IT'S NOT A FIGHT CLUB!</span>
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Forget I called it a fight club. It's... um... it's... something else. That is not a fight club. But yeah, it's... a solo thing. Sort of. I have like... a... boss...? But it's not a job. I mean, it IS, but not like, a monetary job. </span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you are losing me, toots.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Yeah I don't know how to explain this and I'm doing a really bad job. Just know that if I walk away from it, even temporarily, there's no one to pick up my slack.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>that sounds lonely</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>and thats coming from someone who has been alone most of her life</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>cause at least when I was doing shit alone I was doing things I LIKED</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>if I wasn't having fun I just stopped</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I mean, I guess it can be lonely. I've never really thought about it? You're my first like, close-close friend, so.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>oh okay thats actually kind of sad</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>what about um... sylas? or your friends at the party? or even like your brother?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Sylas... isn't REALLY a friend. He WAS a friend at one point, maybe. But, like most people I let too close, he was just using me to grab for power. Surprise, surprise. I guess that's why I let you closer than anyone else; you didn't know me. You and I kind of became friends before you knew who I was, so you didn't have like, a motive to further your own goals through me.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>...is this a bad time to admit to social media stalking</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>...What?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I was gonna mention it but it never like, was a good time</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i know you're a crownguard or whatever</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>that means like, nothing to me, but i didn't wanna hide it from you</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Lux?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>are you mad at me</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I'm trying not to be. Give me a minute.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>okay</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I appreciate you telling me. I'm just... trying to process. How long have you known?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>a few days</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I wish you would have told me sooner.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I know. I'm sorry</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I didn't think it was that important</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i mean like first of all I don't even really know what or who the crownguards are, and even if i did, you're not... a crownguard first to me, you know</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you're my luxy first</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>my best friend second</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>a noble learning about the little people third</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>and a crownguard disatant fourth</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I don't have a right to ask you to be completely transparent with me after I just spent like fifteen minutes talking around what I actually do for my extracurricular, but I'm going to ask anyway. You really don't care that I'm a Crownguard? Like, I know it's easy to just say "no," but even the idea of power can corrupt people. And if that's how this is going to develop, I don't want to... keep this going.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>no pressure or anything though right? lol</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i'm corrupted enough lol and you've been helping me like</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>un-corrupt</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>power grabs aren't really my thing</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>they're too much boring planning instead of like, fun planning</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>if I wanted to cause damage i'd just DO it, i wouldnt need your help or the help of your family name, you feel me?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>plus, people who grab for power wanna like, rule or some shit, right?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>WAY too much work</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>so like. you don't have to believe me</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but know that I like YOU, as LUX, not as Luxana Crownguard.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Oh ew hearing you say my full name just made my stomach drop don't do that</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>LOL right, I felt the same way when I found it out</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but you're just my little luxy baby</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Okay. Thank you. I... really needed to hear that.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>who, for the record, is WAY cooler than some weirdo high-ranking noble, even if she's a total dork and nerd</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Rude!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I'm a rude bitch!!!!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Thank you. For being my real friend.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>thank YOU for being MY real friend</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i think we've established we both think we're beyond true friends for one reason or another</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>which is why we're perfect for each other</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You're probably not wrong about that</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>hey.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>?</span><br />

<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>payback <span class="x1F608"><span class="hide">(Smiling Face With Horns )</span></span></span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but fr. you mean a lot to me and you've been through some shit today and im sorry i added to it</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but you're an important person to me</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You're important to me too. More than I can say.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>its funny</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i havent known you for long</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but you're probably the most important person in my life</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>which okay maybe doesnt mean a lot coming from me since i dont have a lot of people in my life to start with</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>No, it means a lot. You're... probably one of my most important people in my life, too.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you're just saying that</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you dont have to say it back goofball</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I'm serious. Honestly, I have the least walls up when I'm talking to you. Even if that's hard to believe. My brother knows less about me than you do. And you asked about my friends from the party earlier... they're nice and all, but I kind of try to keep them at arms length. Even if they aren't all the type to use me, I have a feeling I'm more trouble than I'm worth for some of them, and they're too polite to say so. That's not self-deprecation, that's objective. I'm headstrong and don't always consider all my options before acting. It can get me into hot water, and sometimes it drags them into the pot with me. So, like... I wouldn't call us fair weather friends, but... and I like, I never really noticed it wasn't "normal" until I realized what you and I have is different. It's... more.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Oh god I'm sorry, I don't know where that came from.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Please stop typing, the idea of you sending me a huge paragraph is giving me anxiety, just ignore everything I just said!!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>no it's not a paragraph</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i just cant figure out what to say to that like</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i keep typing and erasing and typing and erasing</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>not in a bad way!! you didn't scare me off. I just do not know what to say to that</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I'm havibg a lot of Feelings over it</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I'm sorry &gt;.&lt;</span><br />

<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Oh my god, no, don't be! I'm not entitled to know everything you're thinking or feeling. I just didn't know if it would help or not.</span><br />
