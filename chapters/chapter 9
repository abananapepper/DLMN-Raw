<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>They.</span><br />

<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>:P</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>The oh-so-secret, never to be named They.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Oh, like you don't have any secrets.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I think I've told you, but I'm pretty much an open book!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you can ask me pretty much anything really</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Which reminds me, I still have to give you my twenty questions day. Since you had yours.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>oh hell yeah</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>WAIT DONT CHANGE THE SUBJECT</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Almost had you. You have the attention span of a gnat.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>not the worst weakness I have</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Ohh, so what is, then?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>STOP TRYING TO DIVERT MEEEEEE</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I thought you were an open book?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>IT'S NOT A SECRET I'M KEEPING</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I'M JUST NOT LETTING YOU DISTRACT ME FROM MY GOAL</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>And that goal is...</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>to learn all your tricky secrets!!! You've no doubt got a million of them!!!!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>not for my own gain or blackmail of course</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I just love secrets</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Why do I get the feeling you're not very good at keeping them?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Um hello!!! I don't recall telling you any secrets told to me by others!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I figured everyone within a five-mile radius of you automatically assumed your secrets were not safe with you, and kept them to themselves. :P</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>The disrespect!!!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>The utter lack of trust!!!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>From you, Lux, my oldest and dearest friend!!!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I've been wounded!!!! What they say is true!!!! Betrayal never comes from your enemies!!!!!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Pick yourself up off the ground, drama queen.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Never! I'll lay here until the dramatic flower petals falling on my scene drown me!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You can't... you can't drown in flower petals.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I can try!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I.... guess so, yes. But why? I feel like that's a boring way to go.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>to make you feel bad.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You're going to try and make me feel bad by imaginary-drowning in petals, which you can't drown in anyway.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Correctomundo.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You're impossible.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I've been told that before</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>As long as we're friends, you'll probably hear it a whole lot more :P</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Oh, cruel fate</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>FRIENDSHIP</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You started this, remember. You ASKED for this.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>OH CRUEL FATE</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Always so dramatic.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>You wouldn't have me any other way! <span class="x1F61B"><span class="hide">(Face With Stuck-Out Tongue )</span></span></span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Oh yes, of course not. :P</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>So when'd you reschedule for?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Reschedule?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>oh my GOD and you said I had a short attention span</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>the super secret meeting with They!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>OH. Tonight. I usually try and do it early in the morning if I can, but of course that wasn't going to work today. I kind of knew that last night before the party, so I pushed it back to the afternoon. Thinking I'd be responsible enough to make it to it on time. But I guess we're doing tonight instead.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Are you gonna be okay to go tonight?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I should be. I took a couple advil and slept some more, and my brother made me some coffee, so it's slowly getting better.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Ooooooh, your big brudder knows you got wasted????</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>....unfortunately.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>HOW MUCH SHIT DID YOU GET IN LOL</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Not as much as you'd think. But I think it was mostly because I had dirt on him, too. We kind of had a meeting in the hallway late last night; I was getting up to go to the bathroom, and he was coming home with his girlfriend as sneaky as can be. He gave me this like, stern look that both said "I'm disappointing in you" and also "please don't tell mom and dad about this."</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>OMG OMG OMG</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>So the reason I woke up the first time wasn't because of your text actually, it was because he was knocking on my door. He had advil and water and a cup of black coffee, and he was like "now I hope you realize how much danger or trouble you could have gotten yourself into last night," and everything. And then his voice got real low, and he said "but I can keep a secret if you can." And that was that.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>WERE YOUR PARENTS HOME LAST NIGHT????</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>They were both asleep when I got home, so I assume they were asleep when he got home, too.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>who knew the goodie-two-shoes family had TWO delinquent children???</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>are you gonna let him off the hook?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Oh, of course. As much of a pain as he can be, he's a good brother. And it wouldn't be such an issue in the first place if my parents liked his girlfriend.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>oh shit</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>do you like her?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>or is she like a total bitch</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>No, I like her. She's very pretty. Elegant. Strong-willed, but not bossy, which is good for Garen. And they seem happy.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>so whats your parents problem?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>She's Ionian.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>????? so????</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>My parents would rather he settle down with a nice Demacian girl. Preferably someone closer to his status. They are... very protective of our "good family name."</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>so if it was a demacian girl he brought home last night, he could have banged her and not gotten in trouble???</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>that doesnt make ANY sense</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Well no!!! But they'd give him a lot less trouble about it. Probably.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>y'all are so weird</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>so what about you? do they expect you to hook up with a nice demacian?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Eugh. Don't even get me started. They've tried to set me up before and it's... not gone well.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Ooooh, care to share with the class?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>He was nice enough, I guess!! Just too stuffy!! And kind of all about himself!! And his dad, oh my god, he would not shut up about his dad. He was gentlemanly, I guess. Very nice. Just... not... my type. Not at all.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>so what is your type?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I don't know!!! I don't think I really have one, but he was like... not it. He just was not it, Jinx. When I see my type, I'll know it.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Will you, though?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I... I think so??? I don't know???</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I don't think people really have types most of the time</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I think maybe they might have preferences</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but I think people are too unpredictable to really have solid "types"</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>THEN WHY DID YOU ASK</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>cause I was curious!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>also to see if I could be more philosophical than the smart girl<span class="x1F61B"><span class="hide">(Face With Stuck-Out Tongue )</span></span></span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>So you really think people just like... their idea of an ideal partner... I can't phrase this. People will end up with people other than their idea of an ideal partner?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I mean yeah!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>nobody's perfect</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>and especially if their type is like, physical?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>like ooh, I'm into men with long dark hair and green eyes and freckles and muscular but not TOO muscular, and he'll be strong and rough but gentle with me and cooks dinners every other week yadda yadda yadda BLEUGH</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>most people's ideal partner doesn't exist</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but I don't think that means people have to settle exactly</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I think people don't always know what they want or need until they've experienced it</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Woah. Jinx that... was actually pretty profound. What the heck?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Aww, you flatter me</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>people are just so interesting!!!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>this is what I think about when I can't sleep at night, is just like... how people work</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>also plans for pranks and destruction, but you know.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You're not like. Secretly a robot who studies humans so that one day you'll bring us all to our knees, right?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>not HUMANS Lux, PEOPLE</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>ok to answer your question: no, but I wish I was</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>ANYWAY, HUMANS are just like. meat sacks. blood. guts. whatever.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>PEOPLE are like... the... brainy bits that make the humans tick.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>people is the BEHAVIOR of humans. being a person is the act that a human does</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>... You're losing me.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>UGH whatever it doesn't matter</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>THE POINT IS I HAVE A LOT OF INTEREST IN PEOPLE SO IT MAKES ME THINK THINKY THINGS</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Very interesting thinky things. And I mean that, I don't mean interesting in like, the patronizing "wow.... that's.... interesting" kind of way but it's actually like, it interests me. I don't always follow, obviously, but it's interesting to hear you talk about your ideas on people.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you better not say that if you don't mean it</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you'll never get me to shut up if thats the truth</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>It is the truth. It makes me think in ways I never would have thought, and it's fun to listen to you talk about something you're passionate about.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>...you're weird.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>What!!!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you're the first person who's ever been like... like...</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>interested</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>with me</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>about things</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>That just makes the other people you've known really dumb to not see that you're really fun when you're interested in things!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>heh</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Yeah I guess</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>If only there were more girls in the world like you, Lux</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>What, more spoiled-brat smarty-pants know-it-alls with too many secrets? :P</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Yeah, sure</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>take my compliment and turn it into a joke u butt</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I appreciate the compliment, I do. &lt;3 I guess I just wasn't expecting it, and it's difficult for me to accept compliments sometimes, so I often divert them with humor. It's something I've been working on lately, but it's a work in progress.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Ohh, I unlocked a little more Lux Lore</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You're a dweeb.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I gotta unlock your tragic backstory!!!!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but I gotta collect all the Lux Lore to do that</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You're a DWEEB. I'm gonna go for a bit, Garen needs me to distract our parents so he can sneak his girlfriend out.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>if you get caught just say you know you're adopted</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>God if that were true my life would make SO much more sense</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>AHA! MORE LUX LORE</span><br />
