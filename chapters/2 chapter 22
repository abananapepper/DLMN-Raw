<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>So do I want to ask how you knew I was seeing Jarvan for any amount of time?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you told me yourself?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Mm, I don't think so. I told you I was going on a date, but I don't think I told you who it was. Which, I wanted to after a couple dates, but you weren't exactly around for me to talk to about it. :P</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>ah.</span><br />

<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you're not going to like the answer i give you</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>and you'll prolly get mad at me</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>and i am not sure I want you mad at me so soon after we patched things up.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I won't get mad.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Promise?</span><br />
<span class="text22"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>...no.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>But you should tell me anyway.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>UGH</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I had a friend follow you on your first date</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Oh, that's not so bad. Thank you, actually.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>?????</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I was meeting a stranger!! He could have been anyone!! I'm glad I had someone watching out for me in case he turned out to be a creep.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>OH</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>YEAH</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>SURE THING</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You could have at least come said hi though :P</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>first of all, it was a friend of mine, it wasnt me</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>second of all i would have ruined his chances with you the instant you laid eyes on me</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>u woulda seen my smokin hot visage and immediately forgotten who you were supposed to be on a date with</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Uh-huh.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>we woulda ridden off into the sunset without a thought of that demacian dude between those eyes of yours</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You either think very highly of yourself or not very much of him!</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>both <span class="x1F60E"><span class="hide">(Smiling Face With Sunglasses )</span></span></span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i mean you're the easiest person in the world to get along with, how tf did he not vibe with you???</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Okay first of all, I am not the easiest person to get along with and you know it. Second of all, it was... mutual. It was a mutual feeling. He was fun, he was nice, he was very charming, but there just... wasn't any spark, y'know?</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>no spark.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Lux</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>he is a PRINCE</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>like, most girls D R E AM of prince charming and u HAD HIM, he was RIGHT THERE, and there was no SPARK???</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I mean! Not really! It wasn't for lack of trying or anything, I really tried to like him! But there was just... something missing. The whole time, something was missing. I couldn't put my finger on it. I still can't! He had all the assets I thought I wanted in a guy but there was just... something. There was just something that wasn't there. You know?</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>no,</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i am a lesbian,</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>In THEORY, then!</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>in theory maybe?</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>my dating history has been...</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>what's a know-it-all word you'd use?</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>fraught</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>thats a good one</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>so on one hand i cant say i ever experienced attraction to someone where there wasn't any spark</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but on the OTHER</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>maaaaaybe don't use me as a baseline</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Point taken. ...Ugh. I don't know. I just... it wasn't what either of us were looking for. It wasn't what I wanted for myself.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>fair</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>what DO you want for yourself?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I don't know!! But I think I'll know when I find it. Probably. Anyway, to top it all off, we both got really busy with our own stuff and just couldn't make the time to see each other. Wrap it all together and it just didn't make sense for us to keep seeing each other. Much to my brother's chagrin.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>oh right this was your brother's friend or smthn right?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Yeah.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>how'd he react to the whole thing?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>It's... the whole thing was weird. Like, he's the one who set us up in the first place, but then he was like, weirdly protective of me? More than usual, anyway, he's always been a "momma bear" sort of big brother, so to speak. Like, he'd try to warn me about Jarvan, but he'd start walking it back halfway through his warning, like "but he's a really good guy, he's always been a good friend to me" sort of thing. And then when we broke up... I think he wanted it to be messy. You know? He wanted someone to be mad at. Either me for breaking his friends heart, or Jarvan for breaking his baby sister's heart. But no, no such luck, so he sulked about it for a little bit.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>LOL</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>thats</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>a little bit weird</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>is that a normal sibling thing?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I don't know...? I don't think so. I've never felt that kind of protective over him.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>maybe its just a brother thing</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Maybe. It's weird. The whole thing was weird, and I'm glad it's over, and now that you're up to speed I don't think I want to talk about it anymore.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>heard loud and clear</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>hows that uh</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>job... thing.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>the not-job obligation thiing</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>the super secret one</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>It's.... fine. Difficult. I think something big is on the horizon, but my... boss... isn't saying much about it. They're really cryptic most of the time, and it's only gotten harder to decipher what they're saying the more I feel like something is coming. Something... not bad, but different.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>does their super-cryptic-ness rub off on you?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I can't! Tell you! Much! About it!! We've gone over this!!</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I knowwwww but it makes me super super curious</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>like how can you tell something is coming!! what do you mean!!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>It's just a feeling I have. Like a gut feeling.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Lux, most people call that anxiety</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>No no no, I know what that feels like, believe me, I am very familiar with it, and this is not that</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>hmm</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>well</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>does it feel like it's a bad thing?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I... don't know. I don't think so. Normally when there's something bad about to happen there are like... signs that something bad is going to happen. You know? Like clues.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>zero clue what that's like chika</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>to me, bad things just Happen without warning, and then I have to figure out what to do about it</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>beside the point</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>my POINT is, if it doesnt feel bad, maybe its good?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Maybe. Maybe! I didn't think about it like that. ...But now that I say it like that, you're probably right, there's probably some anxiety mixed in with the feeling of something coming. I kind of just assumed it was another disaster.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>another???</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I count you uprooting yourself from my life as a disaster, yes :P</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>oh</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>thats a little flattering ngl</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Please tell me you're joking. *That's* flattering???</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>my ENTERING people's lives is usually seen as the disaster, Lux. not the other way around</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>NOT THE POINT</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>WE'RE UNPACKING YOUR SHIT RN NOT MINE</span><br />
<span class="text22"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I can't stop laughing</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I missed you.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>stop, i'll get a big head</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i missed you too.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Promise?</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>promise</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i wouldn't have left if i didnt think i had to</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I still think you're stupid for thinking you had to. For not... talking it out with me first. Or something.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i know</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>communication... isn't something i had to be good at before</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Mm, I actually have a hard time buying that.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>??????????</span><br />

<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>But they *do* tolerate you. Which means, to some degree, you do communicate with them.</span><br />

<span class="text22"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>No no, you're fine, you didn't overstep. I guess I'm just kind of surprised. I just assumed anyone who got close to you, you spoke to them they way you do with me.</span><br />
