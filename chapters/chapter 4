<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I can't believe the outdoors make you "itchy."</span><br />
<span class="time"><b>June 12th</b> 3:27 PM</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>First of all, you can't expect me to be awake that early after we stayed up last night.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I didn't. I only texted you once, cause I knew you were probably asleep. ( ' ౪ ' )</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Second of all, twice in a row you're texting me first, Lummey! I'm touched!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Careful, I'll start to get the idea we're becoming friends.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>No comment.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>A dangerous yet non-committal response, I see.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>And third of all, the outdoors DOES make me """"itchy""""</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>It's such a beautiful day, X!!! The sun is out!!! The sky is clear!!! It's warm but not hot!!! It is the perfect summer day and I cannot believe you don't like being outdoors!!! What is your deal!!!!</span>
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I just don't like it what's not to get</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>On days like this, everything!!! The colors are bright, the sun feels good on your skin, the fresh air feels good in your lungs...!!!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Itchy.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I'm getting itchy from you just talking about it.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>( ●︿● )</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>So are you some kind of shut-in or what?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Didn't your parents ever teach you manners?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Sure they did, but I didn't think I was minding my manners with you. Considering our history.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Ooooh, we have HISTORY now?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Yeah. Demacian History. Come study with me and Sylas. Are you dodging the question because you ARE a shut-in and don't want to admit it?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>No, snarky-pants.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I'll have you know I'm outside PLENTY.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I'm just not out in the GREAT OUTDOORS like YOU</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I'm a city girl, Lum-Lum.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I mean the city has it's charms too, sure, but to be like, OUTSIDE-outside is to be in a park or a forest or something!!!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Pass.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Spoil-sport.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Is it somehow MY fault that I don't like being out in the "OUTSIDE-outside"?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>When was the last time you TRIED to enjoy the outdoors, really TRIED?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Lumen, I feel like if you have to TRY to enjoy something, you're not really enjoying it.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>L You're just pretending to like it because it makes you "cooler" or "easier to deal with" or something.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>And I will have you know I am plenty cool, and pride myself on how un-easy to deal with I am.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Well, you are nothing if not un-easy to deal with. ( = ౪ = )</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Someone is in a very good mood today</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Who wouldn't be with all this sunlight!!!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>What are you, a plant?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Yes! I am a beautiful sunflower! Reaching up towards the sky! Be a sunflower with me, X!!!!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Are you like</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>okay</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>This is starting to sound forced</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I am *enjoying* myself, X!!! This is the first day in practically forever that it's been this nice and I've had the whole day to myself. No family commitments, no schoolwork, no extracurriculars, no study buddies... just me, myself, and I, out here alone, free to be myself. I just want you to feel the same way, and you can't unless you are soaking up the sun rays!!! You need to get OUT!!! In the fresh air!!! Stop being "itchy"!!!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>See, I think that's where our major difference is, Lumey.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>You are a daughter of a well-to-do family and, what, the youngest? Am I right?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Yeah? What does that have to do with anything?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>So you're like, the family darling. You're probably a straight-A student, who tries to do everything you can, while your parents try to put pillows under you while you fall.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>You probably feel empowered to take on even MORE responsibility since you're treated like the baby of the family</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Like "Oh no, little Lumen, you're too little for that! Let us do it for you, poor dear!" or something</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>So you try and do everything you can, or they'll let you do, and you end up overloading yourself with all this STUFF, so when you get a quiet moment to yourself it's like crack.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Meanwhile, I do whatever I want!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I am ALWAYS free to be myself, babey!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I don't need the power of the sun's deadly rays to make me feel like myself.</span><br />
<span class="time"><b>June 12th</b> 2:15 PM</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Are you ignoring me?</span><br />
<span class="time"><b>June 12th</b> 3:29 PM</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Lumeeeeeennnnnn</span><br />
<span class="time"><b>June 12th</b> 5:21 PM</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Please don't ignore meeeeeeee</span><br />
<span class="time"><b>June 12th</b> 6:58 PM</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Lumen Lumen Lumen Lumen</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Why couldn't you let me have my one thing?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Huh?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Why couldn't you let my have my dumb sunshine-infused happiness? Why did you have to make me sound stupid? I've had a really rough last few weeks, and going out today was my bright spot, and you tried to take it from me because you're somehow "better" than me because you do whatever you want. Why? Why would you do that? I only texted you because I was thinking of you and figured we could have a conversation. Was I wrong to do that? Should I just not talk to you first, and wait til you get bored? Or should I just not talk to you at all if you plan on being negative or making me feel bad about myself every time we talk?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Oh wow okay.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>So I'm the bad guy here</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>That's fine, I'm used to that</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>But you tried to make me feel bad about not liking to be in the Great Outdoors like you.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>So go ahead and pretend you're blameless in this if it makes you feel better</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>But if I start firing shots in your direction without being provoked, trust me. You'll know.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>And what is that supposed to mean?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>It means I don't just shoot to wound, I shoot to destroy.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>It means I wouldn't just take pot-shots at your upbringing and youngest-child syndrome</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>So you admit you were taking pot-shots? And how do you know you didn't "destroy" with your stupid comments? You have no idea the effect your words can have on people. And DID have on me.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>So you're just going to ignore the fact that you started it!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I did NOT instigate. Excuse me for trying to share my love of the outdoors with you.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Also, if you were "destroyed" by my calling a spade a spade, you are WAY too sensitive</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>and it's good that we're getting this out of the way now</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>before either one of us decided to call this a friendship</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Was I taking pot-shots? Yes. </span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Do I regret it? ...no! Not really.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Seriously???</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>When you're content believing you didn't hurt me?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Nope! No regrets.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I cannot believe you. I can't believe I cared about you. I can't believe I started to let you get close to me, that I started to consider you a friend. It just goes to show everyone will hurt you in the end, and letting people close to you really just is not worth the trouble. Everyone only cares about themselves.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you cant guilt trip me so</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>go cry about it lol</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You disgust me.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Oh, really?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>well, get in line then, sweetpea!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you aren't SPECIAL for hating me, sorry if you thought you were.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>there's a whole laundry list of people who I disgust!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Oh, I wonder why! Maybe if you worked on being nicer, and holding your tongue, people might like you more, X. Maybe if you put a little thought in to what you said instead of just shooting your mouth off, you might have more friends.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>If I need to edit and filter myself so that stuck-up rich girls can walk all over me and call me their "friend"</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I'll pass!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Thanks for the offer, though. Very thoughtful.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>How dare you! You don't know ANYTHING about me. You have NO right to call me names like that.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I know everything you told me about yourself, chickie!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Or did you forget?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>You're pretty free about dumping random information on a stranger despite claiming to be "soooo careful about letting people in"</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>And you know what!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>You know even less about me!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>So please,</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Save your poor, dainty little fingers and stop lecturing me.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Fine. Good riddance, too. I don't need your kind of negativity in my life, nor do I need anyone who treats me the way you do. You aren't worth my energy or my time.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I'm so hurt.</span><br />
