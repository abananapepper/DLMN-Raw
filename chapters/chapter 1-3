<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Hey, are you awake?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Hex?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>And here I thought you were the kind of person to go to bed at a reasonable hour.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I did go to bed at a reasonable hour</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>But I can't sleep.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>And you don't actually know me, so you're the only person who I won't worry by texting this late at night.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Did I wake you up?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>You wound me, Lumey. You really think I wouldn't worry about you?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Are you worried?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Nope. <span class="x1F61B"><span class="hide">(Face With Stuck-Out Tongue )</span></span></span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>(¬_¬)</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>So what's wrong that you have to turn to little old Hexy in the dead of night?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Nothing.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I just can't sleep.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Lumen, you wouldn't LIE to me, would you?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Me, your good good friend Hex, who has been nothing but sweet and wonderful to you?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You tried to make me believe you were my friend's non-existent brother who was secretly in love with me.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Touche.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>But you gotta give me SOMETHING to work with here, Lumey. </span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>You can't just text me out of the blue in the middle of the night and expect me to carry the conversation.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Even though I probably could.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Because I'm just that amazing.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Why are you even still awake?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>My sleep schedule is what you might call... "chaotic"</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Why does that not surprise me</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Rude.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Do you even sleep at all?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Rude!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I'll have you know I sleep plenty.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>When?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I live most of my life like a cat.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>When I want to eat, I eat.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>When I want to sleep, I sleep.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>When I want to tear around the place like a maniac, I tear around like a manic.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>When I want to knock someone else's glass off the table, I knock it off the table.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I get it.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>You really are in a sour mood!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Bad dream? Boy problems? Indigestion?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>It's nothing, I'm just tired.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Then sleep!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I cant!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>WHY!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>UGH</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>It's none of your business!!!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Down, boy! May I remind you, YOU texted ME first this time.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>If you're going to behave this way, I'll go elsewhere.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Wait, please don't. Please. I'm sorry. I just don't want to talk about it.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Now was that so hard?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Use your words, Lumey.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>So what DO you wanna talk about?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I... don't know. Any time I try to think of something my mind comes up blank. I'm better at talking in person than over text.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Well then you are in luck, because I much prefer text to in-person encounters.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Ever play the question game?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Once, with a guy in my class. It... didn't go well, to say the least. It kind of devolved into him asking uncomfortable questions and me dodging them. It wasn't a great time.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Ew yuck. That's why you don't play with boys.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Ours will be much more interesting and less uncomfortable.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I reserve the right to pass any questions, though.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Ok, but I reserve the right to ask another after you pass.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Fair. Go ahead, you start then.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Are you a boy or a girl or otherwise?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>A girl. Did you really think I could have been a boy? Not that I'm upset over it, but I guess that's kind of baffling to me.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Is that really your question?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>No! I wouldn't waste it on that.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>That's the last "is that your final answer" warning, toots.  <span class="x1F61B"><span class="hide">(Face With Stuck-Out Tongue )</span></span></span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>(－‸ლ) Noted.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>What about you, are you a boy, girl, or otherwise?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>A girl! Probably, anyway. I don't think about it too much.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>How old are you?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Pass.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>What!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I'm not giving you any identifiable information about me. You could be a weirdo stalker who is tracking my location through my phone right now.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Or I could just be a random person you texted by accident who wants to know if she's talking to someone around her age or not!!!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You've already proven to be a liar, and you told me yourself you do whatever you feel like. I don't feel safe giving you my age.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Uuuuugh.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Fine.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Are you in high school, at least?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>...Yes. Don't ask me what year.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I'll take it.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Are YOU in high school?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>As a matter of fact, I am!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Who knows, maybe we go to the same school.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Or, maybe you're just copying my answers to make you seem more relatable.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>So cynical! So jaded! How did you get so cold!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>That's not my question.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Wait, yes it is. What makes you so cautious?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I... my family is a very prestigious. There are a lot of people who would harm me, or would manipulate me for their own gain. I learned to be careful of strangers and people getting close to me at a young age, which is hard, because like... I want to help people? But a lot of people who need my help ARE strangers, so it's like, hard to balance. My brother is very protective of me, as well, and I'd hate for him to worry over me any more than he does.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Wow that sure went.... somewhere.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Are you more of a city or nature person?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Ignoring my sarcasm won't make it go away, you know.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>But I'm a city gal. Nature makes me itchy.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Not in an allergy way, but more like a... metaphysical way.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Who is Sylas?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>A classmate.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>What's your dream vacation?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Oh come ooooon. You can't give me more than that??? He's a CLASSMATE???</span>
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You're awfully pushy for someone who said this was going to be more fun than the last game of 20 questions I played.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>My dream vacation would be to an airship cruise, with a glass bottom floor so I could look down on the world from way up high.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>If you had to eat only one kind of food for the rest of your life, what would it be?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>And by "what kind," I mean like, all breads, eggs cooked any way, every pasta ever, things like that.</span>
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Hmm... probably pie? Because you can put pretty much anything in a pie, right? Pot pie, desert pie, mountain pies... you could probably put eggs in a crust and call it a pie.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>First of all, I think if you put eggs in a crust it's called a... quiche? I think that's how you spell it? So that's pushing it.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Second of all, WHAT is a mountain pie?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You've never had a mountain pie???</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I've never even HEARD of a mountain pie, and I'm like 80% sure it's something you're making up to get more food forever.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Aaaaaa mountain pies are so good!!!! So like, you have a special mountain pie press, which like... okay imagine you have two little cast iron pans, right? Like, maybe a little bit bigger than your hand. And they hook together to make a space between the pans you cook things inside, like a panini press. And then each pan has a long metal rod attached to it like... like a marshmallow roasting stick, and you hold it over a campfire or put it in the embers.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Oh right!!! Inside you put bread, with the outsides buttered like you would with a grilled cheese, and between the bread you put whatever you want. Apple pie filling, pasta sauce and cheese, marshmallow fluff and peanut butter... whatever!! They are SO SO SO good.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>My dear Lumen, what you are speaking of, is a sandwich.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>And doesn't count as a pie</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>It does too! You didn't even know what a mountain pie WAS until I just told you.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>But now I do know what it is! And it is a sandwich.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>It literally has PIE in the NAME!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Would you put shaving CREAM in your coffee?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>That's totally different.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Is it?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Shaving cream isn't even a food! At least mountain pies are still edible.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Is a rice cake a cake?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Oh, alright, that's a fair point. But if you're going to take egg pies and call them quiches, you could at least give me mountain pies.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I will give you quiches instead so you can have a rounded breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Because I'm so gracious like that.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Why thank you, o benevolent Hex.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Ugh</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Don't call me Hex anymore please</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>It just doesn't fit.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Are we past the whole code names thing yet?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>There's nothing stopping you from giving YOUR name.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>So you admit Lumen isn't your real name then?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>...oh pox.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Not like I didn't know that ANYWAY</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but now I know for SURE</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>So can we like</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>stop using fake names</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Remember when I told you why I'm so cautious, and implied I don't really trust you? Yeah. You can keep calling me Lumen for now, thanks. If you'd like me to call you something other than Hex, I'll be glad to.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Uuuuuugh.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Fine. You can call meeeeeeee</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span> X, I guess.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Just X?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Yeah, for now. We'll see how long that sticks.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I thought long and hard about what I wanted my name to be, I'll have you know.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You mean like right now, or...?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span> No, I mean for my actual name, duh!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You picked your name out? </span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Yup!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>You still got the one your parents gave ya then?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Yeah? Is that unusual?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I go by a nickname, if that "counts" for anything.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Nothing wrong with keeping your given name if you like it.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I just didn't like mine</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>so I stopped using it.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>That was yeeeeeeeaaaaars ago, though. Honestly I don't think I could tell you my given name if you gave me a whole day to try to remember it.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Huh. Well, okay then.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>And it is a REALLY COOL NAME!!!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>....okay?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>But I don't wanna tell you until I know your name!!! Miss Mystery!!!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Well, I guess I just won't know your really cool name!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>UUUUUUUGH</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>So STUBBORN.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You'll get used to it, I'm sure.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Oh?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Are you planning on talking with me again?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Something tells me if *I* don't talk to *you,* *you'll* talk to *me.*</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Again, YOU texted ME first this time, Lumey.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Shhhhhh. I'm going to try and go back to sleep. I'm feeling a lot better after talking to you. Thank you, X.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>G'night, Lum-Lum.</span><br />
