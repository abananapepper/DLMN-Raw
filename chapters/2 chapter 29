  <i>.... .... .... ....</i>
</p>

<p align="right">Mm... what.</p>

<p align="left">
Oh thank GOD. Listen, I have, I have, I have, a... a situation.
</p>

<p align="right">Breathe. [pause] Am I on speakerphone? You never use speakerphone.</p>

<p align="left">
I'm driving.
</p>

<p align="right">You're <i>what?</i></p>

<p align="left">
<i>I have a situation!</i>
</p>

<p align="right">Okay, fine, I'm awake, I'm paying attention, what's going on?</p>

<p align="left">
I have Lux passed out in the back of my car. I--
</p>

<p align="right">[cross-talk]<i>WHAT?</i></p>

<p align="left">
--let me explain! Let me explain! Whatever you're thinking--
</p>

<p align="right">--X, I swear to god--</p>

<p align="left">
--it's wrong, okay, I don't care what you think is happening, just shut up and-- just shut up! Listen to me! Okay! Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, okay, no cops saw that, we're fine, it's fine.
</p>

<p align="right">
  <i>Talk.</i>
</p>

<p align="left">
I don't know what's going on. I don't know what's going on! I don't know what's going on. Lux randomly texted me that she needed help and sent me her location, which was in this shady part of town, and that's when I started calling you the first time because I was trying anything I could to keep my nerves under control while just <i>flying</i> out the door, I had no idea what I was walking into, I... I took one of my guns, just for safety--
</p>

<p align="right">
Stop. You didn't shoot, right?
</p>

<p align="left">
No, I didn't, I didn't need to, I didn't need it at all, but I didn't know what was going on, Lux basically said "help" and then went completely dark, it could have been-- I didn't know what it could have been, I thought I should-- it doesn't matter, no, I didn't shoot!
</p>

<p align="right">
Okay. Take a deep breath for me, okay? Ten in, ten out. [pause] Again. [pause] Go ahead.
</p>

<p align="left">
I pull up to her location marker, and as I'm getting closer, there's lights. Cop lights. She says "get me out of here." I see her, she's... bad, Kaze, she's <i>bad.</i> Banged up to hell. Nothing broken that I could immediately tell, but like, bruised to all fuck, leaning heavy on a wall, looking like, just, bad. Looking like bad. I jump out, help her to the car, get her situated in the back seat and as soon as we're on the road she just passes out. Exhaustion, I think. I hope. God, I hope. I don't know what's going on. I don't know where I'm going. The cops aren't following, they weren't like, close-close to where she was, but there's no way they weren't involved somehow, right? Why did she even think to call <i>me</i> when it came to running from the cops? I--
</p>

<p align="right">
Breathe.
</p>

<p align="left">
[beat] I don't know what to do. I don't know why I called you. I needed to not be alone with this.
</p>

<p align="right">
No, you absolutely cannot be alone with this, you're right. I'm glad you called.
</p>

<p align="left">
Shut up, you're pissed.
</p>

<p align="right">
You're right, I'm pissed, but I'm also glad you called. Find a safe place to pull over.
</p>

<p align="left">
I can't, Kaz, I have to keep driving, I don't know if--
</p>

<p align="right">
Where are you going?
</p>

<p align="left">
I don't know!
</p>

<p align="right">
What's your plan from here?
</p>

<p align="left">
I don't know!!!
</p>

<p align="right">
So you're going to drive in circles, fending off a panic attack with sheer will, until you, what, run out of gas?
</p>

<p align="left">
I'm--
</p>

<p align="right">
X, you listen to me. <i>Find. A. Place. To. Pull. Over.</i> I'll stay on the phone with you. We will figure out your next steps once you've chilled out a little. 
</p>

<p align="left">
...Okay. Okay. Okay. Hold on. Okay. Um... Yeah, okay. [sound of engine being cut] Okay. ...Okay.
</p>

<p align="right">
Breathe.
</p>

<p align="left">
[voice cracking] I'm breathing.
</p>

<p align="right">
If you need to cry, cry it out.
</p>

<p align="left">
I don't want to, I don't want to, I can't, I have to-- I have to figure out--
</p>

<p align="right">
<i>Cry.</i> Take the endorphin rush that comes with it and just <i>cry</i> X. It'll help with the come-down.
</p>

<p align="left">
I don't want to! Not while you're on the phone, not while Lux is in the back seat, not-- not-- [silence]
</p>

<p align="right">
[long pause] Feel any better?
</p>

<p align="left">
[thickly] Shut up. [beat] Yes.
</p>

<p align="right">
Five things you can see.
</p>

<p align="left">
I hate you.
</p>

<p align="right">
I know. Five things.
</p>

<p align="left">
Steering wheel, diner sign, um... my phone, streetlight... gear shift.
</p>

<p align="right">
Good. How's she doing?
</p>

<p align="left">
She's... still asleep. Breathing. Thank fuck. 
</p>

<p align="right">
I don't think she's hurt bad enough that she'd stop breathing, X.
</p>

<p align="left">
I don't know!
</p>

<p align="right">
I know you don't, I'm sorry. 
</p>

<p align="left">
God... This is so stupid, but this isn't how I wanted to meet her. Not like this.
</p>

<p align="right">
We don't always get to live out the life we scripted in our heads. You can mope about it later.
</p>

<p align="left">
I'm not moping! ... Maybe I am, a little bit. Fuck. Okay. Okay! What am I doing. What am I doing.
</p>

<p align="right">
Do you know where she lives? Any contact info for anyone else she's close with?
</p>

<p align="left">
No, I don't. Which is one of the reasons I'm a little bit freaked out that she asked for <i>me</i> of all people. She has an older brother, for the love of-- I feel like it's in your job description as an older brother to bail you out of trouble, isn't it? Or she has friends who actually, like, know where she lives. Know her family, probably. So like, the only reason I can think of that she asked for me is that this has to be a secret. And if this has to be a secret, I have no idea what to do next.
</p>

<p align="right">
Hmm...
</p>

<p align="left">
Cause like, even if I do figure out where she lives, if I drop her off looking like this, she'll be in deep shit probably. But if I like... If... If I just...
</p>

<p align="right">
"If you take her home to your place." There. I said it for you.
</p>

<p align="left">
Shut up, that's not what I was going to say.
</p>

<p align="right">
Wasn't it?
</p>

<p align="left">
No, it wasn't. But now that you've said it, fine, if I take her back to my place and let her crash for the night, she's probably still in deep shit because she's stayed out all night and her parents sound like a nightmare.
</p>

<p align="left">
<i>Mm...</i>
</p>

<p align="left">
Oh, oh shit. [gently] Hey. [sounds of shuffling] Hey, hey, hey, easy. You don't gotta sit up if you don't wanna, you're good. You're safe.
</p>

<p align="left">
<i>Ff... ow.</i>
</p>

<p align="right">
She awake?
</p>

<p align="left">
<i>Who...!?</i>
</p>

<p align="left">
It's okay! It's okay. It's a friend of mine, I have him on speaker so I could talk and drive at the same time. Kaz, I'll call you back later, okay?
</p>

<p align="left">
<i>Nn... it's okay. It's fine. </i>
</p>

<p align="right">
No, it's okay, I'd be more than happy to get back to sleep.
</p>

<p align="left">
<i>She woke you up? It's like... Jinx, what time is it?</i>
</p>

<p align="right">
Such are the perks of being friends with her. Don't worry about it. [gently] You're the priority right now. I leave you in Jinx's capable hands.
</p>

<p align="left">
[scoff] Go back to bed. And, um. Thanks, Kaz.
</p>

<p align="right">
Don't mention it. Text me later. G'night.
</p>
