  <i>.... .... .... ....</i>
</p>

<p align="left">Hello?</p>

<p align="right">Heyyyyy Lux!!! It's been SOOOO long since we've spoken, how is everything!!!! So listen, I'm in town tonight and--</p>

<p align="left">Oh, um, you-- you don't have to do that act. Thank you. Um--</p>

<p align="right">What happened?</p>

<p align="left">What?</p>

<p align="right">You asked me to call, what's up?</p>

<p align="left">Oh. Um... [clears throat] I... I dunno why I asked you to call, I'm sorry, I just.... I needed to hear from.... someone... I guess.</p>

<p align="right">Lux, what happened?</p>

<p align="left">Sorry, sorry, sorry, I'm-- I'm sorry, I'll just--</p>

<p align="right">Don't hang up on me. Do <i>not</i> hang up on me.</p>

<p align="left">...god.</p>

<p align="right">Please.</p>

<p align="left">[sniffs]</p>

<p align="right">Look, you... you don't have to tell me what's wrong. Just don't hang up, okay? Just talk with me. Are you still at the party?</p>

<p align="left">Mm-hmm.</p>

<p align="right">Are your girls still there?</p>

<p align="left">Mm-hmm.</p>

<p align="right">...You sound like you're probably still drunk?</p>

<p align="left">I... [heavy sigh, clears throat] yeah, probably.</p>

<p align="right">Are you alone?</p>

<p align="left">Yeah.</p>

<p align="right">Are you somewhere safe?</p>

<p align="left"><i>Yes,</i> Jinx.</p>

<p align="right">I'm just checking. I'm.... [sigh] I'm worried, okay? And I don't worry for just anyone, just so you know. So you're pretty special.</p>

<p align="left">[small laugh]</p>

<p align="right">I got you to laugh! I win, right? I win! What do I win?</p>

<p align="left">[continues to laugh] You really are so dumb.</p>

<p align="right">Well duh, compared to someone as insufferably smart as you.</p>

<p align="left">Your voice sounds different than I'd imagined it'd be.</p>

<p align="right">Oh yeah? What'd you think I'd sound like?</p>

<p align="left">I... dunno, actually. But you know how you have like, certain voices in your head when you read things?</p>

<p align="right">Poor, poor Lux, hearing voices in her head--</p>

<p align="left">[laughing] Oh, will you shut up!</p>

<p align="right">--poor, poor Lux, whatever will we do with her.</p>

<p align="left">You know what I mean, though, right!?</p>

<p align="right">Yeeeees, Luxy, I know what you're talking about.</p>

<p align="left">I have no idea to describe what that voice was for you, but when you started talking--</p>

<p align="right">In my horrible Posh Demacian accent.</p>

<p align="left">--it just wasn't what I imagined. I don't know how to explain it.</p>

<p align="right">Well for what it's worth, you sound exactly as proper and bouncy as I thought you'd be. Maybe a little higher in pitch, though.</p>

<p align="left">In, like, a bad way?</p>

<p align="right">Nah. Nah, it's fine.</p>

<p align="left">...</p>

<p align="right">[quietly] It's um... it's... nice. To hear your voice.</p>

<p align="left">...huh?</p>

<p align="right">You heard me.</p>

<p align="left">....um! So um! What are you up to!</p>

<p align="right">Just hanging out. Talking to you. People watching.</p>

<p align="left">I never would have taken you to be a people watcher.</p>

<p align="right">Eh, it has it's perks. Boring sometimes. But I've got a pretty good spot tonight, and I'll probably stick around a while longer.</p>

<p align="left">Huh. Even <i>I</i> don't really like people watching, and I figured that was more up my alley than yours.</p>

<p align="right">People are just so weird, sometimes I have to watch them. Sometimes they're so... ORDERLY, like... like they know all the rules and follow them to the letter. The LETTER, Lux.</p>

<p align="left">For the most part, that's how society functions.</p>

<p align="right">Something-something we live in a society.</p>

<p align="left">Huh?</p>

<p align="right">Never mind. So it's like they do this... weird dance around each other and around all these unspoken rules. And sometimes it's soooooo BORING. But sometimes it's like... kind of mesmerizing? If that makes sense. And then SOMETIMES humans try and bend their rules, and that's interesting to watch. And then SOMETIMES, they throw the baby out with the bathwater and do WHATEVER, and that's ALWAYS interesting because like... what are they gonna do next!?</p>

<p align="left">I really don't think you understand how turn of phrases work...</p>

<p align="right">I understand exactly as much as I need to know about everything, don't you worry about that.</p>

<p align="left">Basically what I'm getting from your people-watching story is that you're an agent of chaos because you get excited when you see other agents of chaos?</p>

<p align="right">Oh, pfft, no. Good guess, Lu-Lu, but I'm an agent of chaos because it's more fun to be one than an upright, orderly citizen. [laughs] GOD, could you imagine me as anything even close to being orderly? </p>

<p align="left">[laughs] Not in the slightest.</p>

<p align="right">GOD. I think I'd die, actually.</p>

<p align="left">[laughs, sighs] Thank you.</p>

<p align="right">Any time, chickadee. Anyone I need to pants for you?</p>

<p align="left">Nope. No, we're all good on that front, thanks though.</p>

<p align="right">Damn.</p>

<p align="left">It was honestly just that I got too drunk and... couldn't handle myself.</p>

<p align="right">What do you-- are you okay? </p>

<p align="left">Yeah! Yeah... [laughs once] I just... gotta be careful with my secrets when I'm drunk.</p>

<p align="right">Count-point, maybe you just don't keep so many secrets.</p>

<p align="left">Counter-counter-point, that's not my decision to make.</p>

<p align="right">Count-counter-counter-counter point--</p>

<p align="left">[snorts]</p>

<p align="right">--maybe, maaaaybe you'd feel better if you told someone about it. It doesn't have to be me! Even though I'd LOVE the juicy details. But, y'know. Someone.</p>

<p align="left">Someone DOES know, and it's not helping. [pauses] Sylas knows. Sort of. He found out some of it. Because I messed up. And him knowing... doesn't help. </p>

<p align="right">...Well shit. I'm sorry, Lux. I... well, to be straight with you, I was trying to get you to tell me about it.</p>

<p align="left">Oh, I know that.</p>

<p align="right">But now I kind of feel like a dick. [scoffs] You're good at that!</p>

<p align="left">At making you feel like a dick...?</p>

<p align="right">Yeah! I've never really cared about like... how bad I looked to people before. But now I <i>do,</i> and that's a really weird thing to have to worry about all of a sudden.</p>

<p align="left">The Grinch's heart grew three sizes that day.</p>

<p align="right">Are you saying you think I'm a big ugly green monster?!</p>

<p align="left">[cheerfully] You could be! I would never know.</p>

<p align="right">I bet you've seen me before and just don't know it.</p>

<p align="left">I would never know.</p>

<p align="right">Feeling better?</p>

<p align="left">A bit, yeah. Thank you.</p>

<p align="right">Don't mention it! Rambling aimlessly is one of my special talents.</p>

<p align="left">I already knew that, goof. I should get back, I had to hide pretty good to keep anyone from finding me. I'm sure Roki is worried sick.</p>

<p align="right">Have fun, be safe. And I NEVER ask this, but text me when you're home, okay?</p>

<p align="left">I will. Thanks for worrying.</p>

<p align="right">Feel special. I hardly even worry about myself.</p>

<p align="left">Oh, don't you worry. I know how special I am.</p>

<p align="right">Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, smart mouth. Go enjoy the party.</p>

<p align="left">[laughs whole-heatedly] Bye Jinx.</p>

<p align="right">Yeah, yeah. Bye.</p>
