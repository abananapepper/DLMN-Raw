<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>how're you feeling?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Still sore. More sore than usual. I've been soaking in the tub for what feels like three hours, and the hot water feels nice, but it's not really helping the pain as much as I'd like.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>did u take any like, advil or anythin?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I did.</span><br />

<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but can we talk abt it now</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Do we have to?</span><br />

<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but we're gonna have to talk abt it at some point</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I've told you probably more than I should have, can we just drop it?</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>for now, yea</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but like i'm... having a hard time wrapping my head around it. i'm gonna need to talk it out at some point. not now, but. some point</span><br />
<span class="time"><b>August 2nd</b> 9:01 pm</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>it was nice to finally meet you, tho</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>It was ^^ I just wish it had been under better circumstances.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i mean, same, but</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i'll take what i can get</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>it made u feel... real</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I've always been real...?</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>yea but it didnt feel like it</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>u were one of the little ppl that lived in my phone</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I can kind of understand that a bit. But yes, I'm real :P And so are you. It was nice to confirm that for myself too. You look so much different than I though you would.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>oh yeah?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>good different or bad different?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Neither, I don't think. Just different. Taller than I expected, I think. Skinnier. Just as sharp as I'd expected, but softer somehow.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>That thing musta hit your head pretty hard if you think I'M any kind of soft</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You can't fool me. You came running as soon as I said I needed help.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>that doesn't make me soft!!!! it means i care about my friends!!!!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>If you say so</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i am NOT soft</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You are really pretty though.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>...Huh?</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>um</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>look you had a long couple of days</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you got the shit beat out of you pretty bad and youre exhausted</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>we can pick this back up when you've recovered a little more</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You think I'm saying this because my brain's not all here? Jinx. I almost died. There's no other way to look at it; I know you don't fully believe my account of the events, but that... thing... knocked me clean out of my transformation. That has never happened to me before. I've never been beaten this badly before. I've never... I've never had to heal slowly like this. I thought I was going to die. I thought I was dying. Why do you think you're the person I wanted to come get me?</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>okay I'll answer your question but i HAVE to circle back on some of that later</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i figured you called me bc i can keep a secret, and bc if your family found out you were in so much danger you'd be grounded for life</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>...Okay, well, you're not completely wrong, that was part of it. But the bigger part of it was that, I'm not... as invincible as I thought I was. And if that's true, then I don't want to burn out with any regrets left.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>don't talk like that!!! do not talk like that</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you're not going to burn out</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you're going to be fine, you're healing just fine now</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>This time, yes. What about next time I bite off more than I can chew? Or next time I don't have a choice but to fight impossible odds? What happens when backup doesn't come?</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>just quit!!! now!! quit now while you're safe and alive!!!</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>no one else has to know, i'm great at keeping my mouth shut</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>this secret can just... die between us</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I can't, Jinx.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Why not?!?!!?!?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Because there isn't anyone else. Either I keep defending Runeterra, or Runeterra goes up in flames to the next threat. I'm the last bastion.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>why is that your problem!?!?!? the world somehow managed before you were born!!!! a city being attacked is the CITY's issue, not yours!!!!!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I don't have the energy to argue with you about this right now. I can't just quit being a Star Guardian.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>oh my god is that what you're actually called</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>? Yes, why?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>they call you that online too, i figured it was just a weird, lame name</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>? That's a funny coincidence. But yes, my official title is "Star Guardian."</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>this is too much</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>this is all too much</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i feel like im going out of my mind</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>how are we talking about this like its just. normal</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>That's one of the reasons I didn't want to tell you. Why I couldn't tell you. I'm sorry.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>dont fuckin start apologizing like</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>like this is something u can control</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>except u CAN bc u could just QUIT</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>No, Jinx, I CANT. Maybe you're used to running away from things when they get tough or stop working out for you, but I can't, and more importantly, I won't.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>UUUGGHHH YOURE IMPOSSIBLE</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>also, no, fuck you! i didnt run from you. maybe i did at one point but i came back and i fucking apologized and tried to make it right</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>and if u think that was EASY, go fuck urself</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You're right, and I'm sorry. I'm frustrated, I'm in a lot of pain, and I feel like you're not hearing me.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i HEAR YOU i just dont AGREE WITH you</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>sorry. u said u didnt wanna argue and i keep harping</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i'll put a sock in it</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Thank you. I'm sorry.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>don't be</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Hey</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I love you.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>yeah yeah yeah, so you keep saying</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>No, I mean it! I mean like... I... god I was so hoping just... saying it like that would make my point for me, how do I even start to say this...</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>???????</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I'm like... I'm... I LOVE you, Jinx. Like, capital L.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>oh</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>OH</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>WHAT?????</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I realized last night I really don't have the luxury of leaving things unsaid and hoping they'll just... resolve or be found out in time. Like I said, I don't want to go out with regrets</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>STOP SAYING THAT</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>BUT ALSO WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>And I don't expect you to return my feelings, especially right now, but I can't not say them. If this ruins our friendship... then... I guess it ruins our friendship. I hope it doesn't. If you don't feel the same we can just keep things as we are, and really I'd prefer that to us not talking after all this. But I've known for a little while now, I love you. It put a lot of things into perspective when I realized, haha. Like why Jarvan wasn't anything I was looking for; I already knew what I wanted, even if I didn't know that I knew.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>SLOW DOWN. STOP. STOP TYPING.</span><br />
