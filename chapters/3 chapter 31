<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>its BATSHIT CRAZY even if it DOES make sense</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>so i wanna compare notes</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Yasuo:</b></span>But you're not going to tell me what you learned from her, I'm guessing.</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>no</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i cant</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>like i CANT cant even tho i wanna</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Yasuo:</b></span>Fine. That's annoying, but fine. Around midnight, there was a disturbance in downtown Valoran City. Void-flavored disturbance. Valoran's no stranger to weird shit going on like this, but lately there's been a flashy vigilante who's shown up when shit really starts to hit the fan.</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>ive heard a lil abt that before now yea</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Yasuo:</b></span>They're like a cryptid. No one can get a good picture of them, and there's all these wild stories online about them. My guess is most of them aren't true, and they're just clout-chasing forum nonsense, but either way, the general public has seen and knows of this person. They've mostly dubbed them "The Star Guardian," aside from a few outliers who don't like the name</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>????</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i mean yea its stupid name</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>it doesnt make any sense</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>shes not defending a star shes defending a city</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Yasuo:</b></span>She?</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>they</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>sorry</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>hearin a name like "the star guardian" i just assumed</span><br />
<span class="reply11"><span class="hide"><b>Yasuo:</b></span>Hm.</span><br />
<span class="reply11"><span class="hide"><b>Yasuo:</b></span>Anyway.</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Yasuo:</b></span>I can find posts about this from up to a year ago. It's been on and off my radar for a while. What made me look again was, Time and I pulled up a police scanner feed last night.</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>YOU TOLD HIM?????</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Yasuo:</b></span>Not everything, but yes.</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>ASDGASDGASBASHASDASDG</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>WHY DO U HAVE SUCH A BIG FUCKING MOUTH</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Yasuo:</b></span>He only knows you were worried about the cops catching you, I didn't mention anything about Lux.</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>WHY DID U MENTION ANYTHING??????</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Yasuo:</b></span>Because I wasn't about to listen to police scanner recordings by myself</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i hate u sfm</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Yasuo:</b></span>Do you want to hear about what I found or not?</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>yes</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Yasuo:</b></span>Then suck it up.</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>fine</span><br />
<span class="reply11"><span class="hide"><b>Yasuo:</b></span>The scanners were also reporting a vigilante in downtown Valoran.</span><br />
<span class="reply11"><span class="hide"><b>Yasuo:</b></span>Reports about what they looked like varied wildly, but the general sentiment was the same; whoever it was, was fending off a massive void invasion on their own.</span><br />
<span class="reply11"><span class="hide"><b>Yasuo:</b></span>And losing.</span><br />
<span class="reply11"><span class="hide"><b>Yasuo:</b></span>Badly.</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Yasuo:</b></span>Police forces started doing what they could, and it sounded like it became an "all hands on deck" situation. Between the police and the vigilante, things cooled down considerably. Once the situation was under control, they looked for the vigilante for at least a statement, if not to take them into custody</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>????????</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>WHAT???</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Yasuo:</b></span>Vigilantism is technically still a crime, X.</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>BUT THE POLICE WERE USEELSS</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>THE VIGILANTE WAS THERE BEFORE THEY WERE AND WAS HOLDING THEIR OWN AS BEST THEY COULD TIL THE COPS GOT OFF THEIR ASSES 2 HELP</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Yasuo:</b></span>I'm not disagreeing with you, I'm just stating the facts.</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>THIS IS SUCH BS</span><br />
<span class="reply11"><span class="hide"><b>Yasuo:</b></span>They didn't find The Star Guardian, by the way. Nowhere to be found.</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Yasuo:</b></span>It explains the cop lights. It also leads one to draw some interesting conclusions between Lux and why she texted you.</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>idk dude! mayb not!</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>she could b one of the casualties of the void monster things and just. texted me as an escape driver</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Yasuo:</b></span>You said you already spoke to her, yes?</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>yea</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Yasuo:</b></span>So you already know her side of the story</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>yea</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Yasuo:</b></span>...And you're not going to tell me.</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>what u said mostly lines up w what she told me, im telling u she just got caught up in the situation and texted me bc she was scared</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Yasuo:</b></span>So you say.</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>she just hopped out of the shower, im gonna see if she wont let me drive her home</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Yasuo:</b></span>You're dodging.</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i am NOT im being RESPONSIBLE</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>for ONCE</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>ill ttyl. do NOT tell any1 else abt this. dont let TIME tell any1 else abt this</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>last thing i need is the group saying ive gone soft or sme shit</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Yasuo:</b></span>Fine. But in return, you finally tell me about how you actually met this girl, and everything you've been getting up to while you were gone.</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>deal</span><br />
