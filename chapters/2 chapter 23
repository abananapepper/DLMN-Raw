<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i guess i should ask, do you actually want Crusher back?</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i mean, I can't ask a super-hot pizza girl to deliver him, buuut</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I do have my methods, if you do decide you want him back</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>It hadn't even crossed my mind. As far as I'm concerned, he's yours now! I'm not in the habit of asking for gifts back, yknow?</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>wh--</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>okay</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i really thought he was on like, indefinite loan, and I'd have to give him back at some point??</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Do *you* want to give him back?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Well... no,</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Then he's yours ^-^</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>THAT DOESNT FEEL RIGHT</span><br />
<span class="text22"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Why not??</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>If you like him that much, let yourself keep him. Even if we ever stop talking again, for real this time, he's yours. He... he can be something to remember me by.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>oh i do NOT like how that was phrased</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>what's wrong luxy</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>lux</span><br />

<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>anyway you sound sad, out with it</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>What do you mean? We just went through like, a month of not talking to each other, and I don't want that to happen again, but if for some reason we do, you'll at least have a way to remember me.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>see, THAT, it's EXACTLY how you PHRASED it</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>"something to remember me by" is like. you only use that when you're dying. please don't be dying, okay?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Pfft. I'm not dying, Jinx.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Promise?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I mean, no faster than the rest of us, anyway.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>PROMISE?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Yeees Jinx, I promise. :P</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Good.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>It would be just my luck to get a crush on a girl who has like, another week to live or something</span><br />
<span class="text22"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Maybe I am a little melanch</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>what</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>SIKE</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>GOT YOU GOOD, DIDN'T I?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>DON'T DO THAT</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>YOU FORGOT ABOUT MY MICHEVIOUS STREAK</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I had you believing I was your friend's brother for like a few hours when we first starting talking, remember?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I do NOW, YEAH. Stars above, don't DO that!!!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Buuuut I bet you're not sad anymore. Riiiight?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>NO, INSTEAD MY FIGHT-OR-FLIGHT HAS KICKED IN</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>WHAT?!?!</span><br />
<span class="text22"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>YOU FUCKING SCARED ME WITH THAT</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>It was like the whole world turned to jelly for a minute, oh my god.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>oh</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I'm sorry</span><br />
<span class="text22"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>No, don't... don't be like, sad about it, you did knock me right the hell out of my funk, I just had a minor heart attack in the process, that's all. (⁀ ⁀;;) You didn't mean anything by it, it's fine, I'm not mad</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>One of my friends just texted me and we're gonna go for a walk, but I'm not ignoring you and I'm not mad, okay?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I get you! have a good walk</span><br />
<span class="time"><b>July 29th</b> 10:29 pm</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Good god, sorry, things got... heated.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>On the walk?</span><br />
<span class="text22"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Yeah. It...</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>She's not happy that we're talking again.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>could you say that differently please</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i cant wrap my head around that sentence</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>My friend isn't happy that I'm talking to you again.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>oh</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>well I mean that's understandable honestly</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but also, not to be a bitch, but its not her decision</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>That's what I told her, too. And I told her I was happier talking to you than not.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>really?</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you said that?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I cant believe you'd lie to your friend like that smh</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Oh, can it. It's the truth. I was okay after a while, but talking to you makes me happy. Even when you first texted me "hey", my first reaction was for my heart to leap into my throat. I had to remind myself that I was mad at you.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>okay, like, im flattered, but that doesn't sound. great.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>like, probably not healthy</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I know, I know. It's something I've... been keeping an eye on since. Anyway, she and I got into kind of a pretty heated argument on our walk, and because of that I got home late, and my parents laid into me about THAT, like I'm not old enough to be out on my own, and that gave Garen the outlet he needed to be mad at me or Jarvan, so HE started laying into me about being irresponsible and flighty and childish and all these other things that are only half-true, and just... I'm tired. It sucks and I'm tired</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>okay hey wait I'm gonna punch garen???</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>even if i break my fist on his stupid demacian jaw</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>none of those things you just said he told you are true</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>They're sort of true though</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>no, they're not.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>listen to me for a sec, kay</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you're not irresponsible. you're a know-it-all smarty pants who probably worries about her 4.0 GPA even in the middle of summer. You have this side-gig not-job that wears you the fuck out but you still DO IT.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you're not flighty!!! what the fuck!!! i cant even like address this one properly because "flighty" isn't a word id ever use to describe you. me? yes. you? no. not the you that i know.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you're not childish, for gods sake. you're more mature than you really ought to be sometimes and it drives me nuts. sometimes you're naive, i wont argue that, but fuck, you've been a sheltered little golden child for so long how can you not be?? you're learning. if he faults you for that he's even more of a meathead than most demacian dudes</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>sorry. im like, mad on your behalf</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>No no, you're okay. It's... I'm just kind of shocked. I don't think I've heard someone actually come to my defense like that.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I'm calling bullshit on that one, you absolutely have friends who would do the same. esp whoever you got into a fight with today abt me</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I mean that's true, but... I don't know, I guess it's just the intensity that you have when you talk about me.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i'm told I'm a very intense person <span class="x1F61B"><span class="hide">(Face With Stuck-Out Tongue )</span></span></span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I don't think anyone who actually knew you would claim otherwise, no (･౪･)</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>not in their right mind anyway</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>anyway dont let it get to you. people just say shit all the time, esp when they're itching for a fight.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I know. I just wish they wouldn't.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>the world would be a much kinder place if it was the way you imagined it to be, pinky</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>"Pinky"?</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>SORRY, sorry, its just. just calling you "lux" feels too serious</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but luxy is off limits, and i get that, im not arguing that, and 'lulu' just feels. wrong.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Yeah no don't call me Lulu please</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i wont</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i'll stick with just lux for now but if i need to get serious im gonna have to use your full name, fair warning</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I'll consider myself warned (･౪･)</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>feeling better?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>A little, yeah. Thank you &lt;3</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>happy to help chika</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>it's pretty late for you, yeah? you should probably get to sleep</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I don't want to yet. I know my brain is going to run away with my thoughts as soon as I lay down.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>what if you listen to something that keeps your brain active but doesn't uh. keep you from sleeping? if that makes sense</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>It does, but I'm not sure what I'd use. I've tried podcasts and guided meditations and everything, but my brain still wanders despite it.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>yeah no, i get you. </span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You're not going to bed soon, right?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>nah, I just had an energy drink and I've been tinkering in my lab, i'm up for at least a few more hours</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Want to watch something together? I can set up a stream for us.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>oh shit, yea, sure! what've you got in mind?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Honestly, I'll watch anything that's not horror or gorey.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>and something that's easy to fall asleep to probably</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I am *not* going to fall asleep watching something with you, mark my words.</span><br />
<span class="breply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>That's what they all say <span class="x1F61B"><span class="hide">(Face With Stuck-Out Tongue )</span></span></span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>what about like, bake-off or something? that's probably tame enough, right?</span><br />
<span class="readreceipt">Read 1:07 am</span><br />
<span class="text22"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Bake-off sounds perfect. Hang on, let me set up the sharing link. Just... copy this onto your computer.</span><br />
