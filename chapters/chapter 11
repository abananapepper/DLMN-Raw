<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>as you can imagine</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>so it's kind of a hide-out?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but I don't make it a point to not be seen or anything</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>so they probably know</span><br />

<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Do you really think A. I am capable of starting a mob and 2. there are enough people who would WANT to mob you? Were things really that bad?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i mean i dunno</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>ok well first of all, no, I think you wouldn't even know how to start a mob</span><br />

<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>stand in the street and yell "lets start a mob!!!!" in your cute little voice</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>and people would wonder who lost their very tall child in the middle of piltover</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Okay, WOW, rude. Disrespectful. How dare you.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but i dont actually know how many people would like to see me like...</span><br />

<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Don't play dumb with me luxy!!!!!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>what did you DO!!!!!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>are you typing an essay???</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Do you not like pizza? I didn't know if you would like that or chicken better, or if maybe I should have found like a local takeout place? But I knew the pizza place was open this late, and they're usually pretty speedy service. Pizza's usually a pretty safe bet too, sorry if it wasn't great for you, I can figure something else out if you'd like?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>LUX</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>SLOW YOUR ROLL</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I love pizza just like</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>ok first of all HOW</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>second of all WHY</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>GOD this is so good, it's been so long since I've had pizza</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>...Truthfully I asked if they knew a Jinx in east Piltover when I ordered, since I didn't know the exact address, and the girl was like "oh, her, yeah. I can get that to her." And because it seemed like you could use a pick-me-up probably after today's bombshell conversation. And because I didn't really know how else to convince you that we're still friends after all that. I don't want to say I solve ALL of my friend troubles with pizza, but it's become a fall-back when I don't know how else to cheer them up.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you're too good for this world <span class="x1F62D"><span class="hide">(Loudly Crying Face )</span></span></span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>GODDDD I literally don't think I've ever tasted pizza this good</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>The pizza girl made it seem like you ordered all the time o.o</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I USED to, but it's been a while</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Also, food always tastes better when you don't pay for it <span class="x1F61B"><span class="hide">(Face With Stuck-Out Tongue )</span></span></span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>thank you. really.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Feeling better? :3</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>MUCH.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Good. Now buckle up cause I'm gonna dump some stuff on you.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Oh boy.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>So. It obviously does bother me that you hurt so many people. I don't really want to know the means, it just sucks that you did it. But, it's clear you're trying to change, and I do appreciate that. So... I'm not going to say I'll forget about it, and I'm not really the person who needs to forgive you for it, either. But it's something I'm willing to work past, because you're my friend. And because it's not like I don't have my fair share of things I'm not proud of, or secrets. Honestly, it's... really kind of messed me up how easily you told me about all that without even a second thought. And how much I... don't do that. Here I thought I was the more morally upright person, heh. And I mean, my secrets aren't that I've terrorized a town, but like... still, on a personal human level, I guess, it... I don't know. I can't find the right words, I guess.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>You ARE the more morally upright one, don't worry about that</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but you don't have to feel bad about not wanting to talk about things</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>it's more normal for humans to keep things to themselves than spout em all out like i do</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>and its not a contest of like</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>who can bare their soul the most</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>so don't feel like u have to tell me anything u dont wanna</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I... part of me really wants to, is the thing. But part of me knows I can't. Or shouldn't. It's not that you'll think less of me, I think, but it's more like... it'd be potentially dangerous. On a lot of levels. Not because of you, I mean. I trust you. But dangerous in a bunch of other ways</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I get it</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I mean, I don't</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but I respect it</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Thank you. I'm sorry &gt;.&lt; </span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>nothin to be sorry for doll face</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>anyway</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you still got some of those questions for me or did u lose ur list again</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>No, I have it! Where in Piltover are you was actually one of my questions. :P Next up! Favorite breakfast food and why.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>WAFFLES. Because they're just like pancakes but with more crunch</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>and they have built-in diy flavor pockets for whatever you want</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>butter</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>jalapeno jelly</span><br />

<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>if we ever meet the first thing I'm doing is have you try jalepeno jelly</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Okay but it sounds gross</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I KNOW IT DOES YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME THOUGH</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Listen I do trust you, BUT that sounds entirely too gross for me to ever try</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>NOOOOOOOOOOO</span><br />

<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>even with me vouching for it's deliciousness</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>If you had to pick an animal to be for the rest of your life, what would you be?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>oh shit this one's hard</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I suddenly don't know any animals</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Oh come on :P</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>what animal do you think I am?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Nope, that's cheating!</span><br />

<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>A big tropical bird who yells a lot</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>And says bad words at inappropriate times</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Yeah okay that sounds like you.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Hell yeah it does!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Coffee or tea?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Oh coffee.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>easily</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Do you drink it hot or cold?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>at the risk of sounding like a disgraceful gay</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>hot</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Okay, WHAT does that mean</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>OH right you're a baby gay</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>it's usually assumed that gays like their coffee iced</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>at least that's what I've been told whenever I tell people I like hot coffee</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>That... is the most bizarre stereotype I've ever heard.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>RIGHT</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>it's not to the point that like</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>if you get your coffee iced you're automatically assumed gay</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but it's like. idk its a thing</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>at least in my experience anyway</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>It just doesn't make any sense though!!! What about being gay makes you automatically like iced coffee better than hot coffee??</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>literally do not ask me lol</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>besides I JUST told you I like mine hot!!!!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You did, I know you did, it's just... baffling to me. I mean, granted I don't know basically anything about gay culture or anything, but coffee just seems to arbitrary?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you'd be surprised</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you'll learn the ways, little gay.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I suppose so. Just learn as I go along, I guess. How do you take it?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Um.</span><br />

<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>to answer your question, one cream and one sugar</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>enough to cut the bitterness but not enough to completely HIDE the bitterness</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>if my coffee tastes like a dessert, something has gone wrong</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Don't like sweet things?</span><br />

<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>only a little</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You're an odd duck</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>quack</span><br />

<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Maybe.  ≧ 3 ≦</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you could have just ASKED ME</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Maybe I needed to warm myself up to some of these questions!!!!!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>OOOOH NOW I'M CURIOUS</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>HOW SPICY ARE THESE QUESTIONS LUXY!!!!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>GOD stop oh my god. They're nowhere near as scandalous as you're thinking, they're just ones I like... wouldn't... normally ask, I guess.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>so are they like, sleep-over ask-in-the-dark-before-you-fall-asleep questions or</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I... guess so, actually. Though when you say it like that it makes me feel silly</span><br />

  <i>.... .... .... ....</i>
</p>

<p align="left">Why are you calling meeeeeee</p>

<p align="right">So it'll feel more like a sleep over ask-in-the-dark-before-you-fall-asleep question session!</p>

<p align="left">You're making me feel even more silly though, Jinx! I'm just... I feel dumb. I feel like I'm being dumb.</p>

<p align="right">Are you embarrassed?</p>

<p align="left">Yes!</p>

<p align="right">Why though! I told you I'm an open book, I'll answer, like, anything. Even earlier when it totally made me the bad guy.</p>

<p align="left">I don't know!!! I just feel embarrassed!!! It's like... it's.... like... like I'm asking things I shouldn't be asking, probably. Things that aren't polite to ask.</p>

<p align="right">[laughs] Luxy, do I seem like a polite person to you?</p>

<p align="left">I mean--</p>

<p align="right">No. The correct answer is no. I'm not a polite person, Luxy, so don't you worry your pretty pink head about that.</p>

<p align="left">Okay, but like... I just... it feels weird.</p>

<p align="right">Okay. Maybe we make things a little more moody, yeah? Let me just... [shuffling sounds]</p>

<p align="left">What are you doing?</p>

<p align="right">Putting away my leftovers, hang... on... kay. Are you in your room?</p>

<p align="left">Yyyyyes? Why?</p>

<p align="right">Okay I'm headed to my room too, hang on, hang on, hang on...</p>

<p align="left">What are you even doing! What are you getting at!</p>

<p align="right">...hang on, HANG ON, hang on, hang on, hand on... oh shit. I'm gonna put you on speaker.</p>

<p align="left">WHAT is going on???</p>

<p align="right">I'm just getting changed into my pajamas. You should too! If you're not already- no, you probably already are, this is late for you. Oh! You should put me on speaker, too! Like, put your phone on your pillow and-- </p>

<p align="left">Oh. Ohhhh! Oh, I get it. Like a sleep-over. Okay. God, YOU'RE the silly one.</p>

<p align="right">--that way it'll be like-- Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!!! No, shh, I'm brilliant, okay--</p>

<p align="left">You sound like a child who is having their first-ever sleep over Jinx, oh my god.</p>

<p align="right">ShhHHHHH this is a great idea, this is the greatest idea in the world. Are your lights out?</p>

<p align="left">Oh, hold on...... yes.</p>

<p align="right">Okay okay okay okay cool cool cool. Cool. Okay.</p>

<p align="left">...</p>

<p align="right">...</p>

<p align="left">Wow, just like a real sleep-over!</p>

<p align="right">YOU'RE the one with the questions!</p>

<p align="left">[laughs] No, I mean the awkward silence is authentic. Like, how you pretend you're asleep but really wanna talk, but don't know how to bring up you wanna talk about.</p>

<p align="right">OH. Oh. [whispers] Psst. Are you still awake?</p>

<p align="left">[laughs]</p>

<p align="right">Psst. Psst. PSST.</p>

<p align="left">[still laughing] Yeah! Yeah, I'm awake. You awake?</p>

<p align="right">Yeah, can't sleep.</p>

<p align="left">Me neither. [pause] What're you thinking about?</p>

<p align="right">Hm. I don't know if I wanna tell you.</p>

<p align="left">Oh come ooooon!</p>

<p align="right">You sure you wanna know?</p>

<p align="left">Yes!</p>

<p align="right">You.</p>

<p align="left">...Huh?</p>

<p align="right">Thinkin' about you.</p>

<p align="left">Wh... okay, that wasn't--</p>

<p align="right">[laughs] You're so easy to rile up.</p>

<p align="left">Oh, I hate you.</p>

<p align="right">You don't.</p>

<p align="left">I'm gonna hang up on you.</p>

<p align="right">Nooo, don't mention the phone! Don't break the sleepover illusion!</p>

<p align="left">I'm gonna go sleep on the couch then!</p>

<p align="right">Don't do that! I'll miss you. It's dawk and scawwy, and I fowgot my teddie beaw.</p>

<p align="left">You're so different than you are over text.</p>

<p align="right">Am not! I'm just excited is all. I wanna hear your questions, and it's been, like, FOREVER since I've had any kind of sleep over anything. Even like this. It's nice.</p>

<p align="left">...Okay, it is kind of nice.</p>

<p align="right">HA!</p>

<p align="left">And it's good to hear your voice again.</p>

<p align="right">Oh, stop. You'll make me blush.</p>

<p align="left">It is, though. The last time I heard it, I wasn't in a great place mentally. It's... nice to hear it when I'm like... I dunno. When I'm in a better place.</p>

<p align="right">For what it's worth, it's nice to hear your voice too, when you're not having-- not that I minded the last time I called you, you--</p>

<p align="left">No no no no no, I get it, I totally get it, it's okay.</p>

<p align="right">...</p>

<p align="left">...</p>

<p align="right">So what are YOU thinking about?</p>

<p align="left">Um... gosh, where do I even start.</p>

<p align="right">Anywhere!</p>

<p align="left">I guess... I'm thinking I'm glad we're friends. I'm glad you had the idea for this, and I'm kind of wondering why... you... go to such lengths for me? I guess, I don't know, I didn't mean for that to sound self-depr--</p>

<p align="right">Oh please, Lux, you bought me pizza because you knew I was feeling bad. Don't talk about the lengths <i>I</i> go to.</p>

<p align="left">I mean! I guess I'm just... I have friends who are kind to me and everything. But you like, you super go out of your way for me, it feels like.</p>

<p align="right">And I can count my friends on one hand, and you are the nicest person like, ever. So I think it's safe to say we both think we're getting the short end here.</p>

<p align="left">I guess so, yeah. I guess so. [pauses] Okay um... [paper shuffling]</p>

<p align="right">Oh my god, how many pages do you have?</p>

<p align="left">Just one, I have it in a notebook where I put random other thoughts. Not like, not a diary. Cause I have one of those. This is different.</p>

<p align="right">You're not just gonna read to me out of your diary??</p>

<p align="left">NO. No no no no no. Not happening.</p>

<p align="right">Aww, I wanna know all your dirty little secreeeeets!</p>

<p align="left">Keep dreaming. Okay, um... do... you have a girlfriend?</p>

<p align="right">Nah. I mean, come on, do you think anyone would put up with my crazy ass on a daily basis? Like, willingly?</p>

<p align="left">Okay, first of all, I put up with you on a daily basis willingly, and second of all, don't you talk about my friend that way. You really don't give yourself enough credit, you know that?</p>

<p align="right">Okay, sure, but knowing what you know about me now, can you like... blame me? I am a highly fucked up person, and until recently, I've been super okay with that. But it's also like... it's not always great for your self-esteem. You know?</p>

<p align="left">I guess, I nev--</p>

<p align="right">It's just like, hard sometimes. I'm alone a lot. Because no one wants to be around me, for obvious reasons. And like, a lot of times it doesn't bother me. A lot of times I don't even think about it. But sometimes it sucks! Sometimes it does things to my head! And like... I'm... I don't know. I don't want to be such a downer, sorry.</p>

<p align="left">No, no no no, Jinx, it's okay! I don't mind at all. This... it... you haven't told anyone else about this, I'm guessing?</p>

<p align="right">Who is there to tell?</p>

<p align="left">[deep breath] Me. Tell me. Tell me everything, to get it all out.</p>

<p align="right">Lux, I--</p>

<p align="left">No, listen. It's important that your feelings are heard. And it's important to <i>me</i> that you know, after I hear them, that you know that like... I'm still here. I'm still behind you. And I'll prove your insecurities wrong.</p>

<p align="right">.......</p>

<p align="left">Okay?</p>

<p align="right">I... guess. It's just not... something I've ever done, I guess.</p>

<p align="left">If you really don't want to, you don't have to.</p>

<p align="right">I kind of do. I just... don't know where to start, I guess.</p>

<p align="left">From where you left off, if you want. You were saying how being alone messes with you.</p>

<p align="right">Yeah. Yeah, it... it does mess with me. Like, I KNOW why people don't want to be around me. I know. But it's still like... I'm not worth being around. Which, like, obviously. But knowing that, sometimes, is... I mean, how can I not feel like shit about it sometimes? I'm... I'm worthless, Lux. I'm a worthless good-for-nothing, chaos-causing maniac. That's all I am. And that's all I'll ever be. And sometimes I'm okay with that, and sometimes I'm not.</p>

<p align="left">Okay. You're not worthless. I'm sorry you feel that way, but you're not worthless. You mean a lot to me.</p>

<p align="right">Thanks. I... [sigh] I appreciate that.</p>

<p align="left">And there's so much more to you than you're giving yourself credit for!!! You're much more multi-faceted than just being an agent of chaos. You like people-watching, and pizza, and city life... you're good at giving advice and you're a great listener. A great friend. You're someone I don't know how I lived without, really.</p>

<p align="right">[snorts]</p>

<p align="left">Actually, I do know how I lived without you; I was someone who was... very up my own butt, and didn't have a great grasp on reality. But you helped me change, Jinx. You made my life better.</p>

<p align="right">...</p>

<p align="left">You helped me see and grow. And I'm still growing. I have... [laughs once] a LOT of growing to do. But it wouldn't have started without you. And I'm happy for it! And I'm happy you're still here, helping me grow, and learn, and understand things beyond my little bubble. You are... so important to me, Jinx. I can't tell you how important you are to me.</p>

<p align="right">... [sniffs]</p>

<p align="left">Jinx... you're not...</p>

<p align="right">[voice cracking] No.</p>

<p align="left">Jiiiiinx!!! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to m--</p>

<p align="right">I'm not crying, don't say it! [sniffs]</p>

<p align="left">...</p>

<p align="right">[voice wobbling] Okay, so I am, so what? Y...you can't just...</p>

<p align="left">I'm sorry...</p>

<p align="right">No! Stop it. It's... you're... don't... be sorry. Don't be sorry. You just said the nicest things to me I've ever heard in my life. The fuck do you have to be sorry for...</p>

<p align="left">[muffled shifting, mic rubbing up against something]</p>

<p align="right">What are you doing?</p>

<p align="left">[muffled but loud] Hugging you.</p>

<p align="right">...what???</p>

<p align="left">[muffled but loud] I'm hugging you. This is a hug. If this were a real sleep over, I'd come over to your sleeping bag and hug you and tell you how happy I am that we're friends, and that you're a worthwhile person.</p>

<p align="right">[wobbly laugh] You better stop or I'm gonna start crying all over again.</p>

<p align="left">[normally] You've had it really rough, while I've... lived a very charmed life in comparison. I wish I could like, split the difference with you. So we could both have live semi-normal lives. But I can't do that, so all I can do is tell you that I'm here, and I love you, and that you mean so much to me. Thank you for being my friend, Jinx.</p>

<p align="right">You... better s... stop...!!</p>

<p align="left">Don't plan on it, cause I don't plan on stopping being your friend. You're stuck with all my mushy-gushy friend love.</p>

<p align="right">You fuckin... [sniff] sap... god. How did I get...</p>

<p align="left">A sunshine-y leech stuck to you?</p>

<p align="right">...so lucky, is what I was gonna say. How did I get so lucky?</p>

<p align="left">We'll call it fate and persistence.</p>

<p align="right">[laughs loudly] Yeah, I guess so!</p>

<p align="left">[laughs] ...Hey.</p>

<p align="right">Hey yourself.</p>

<p align="left">I do love you, you know.</p>

<p align="right">...Come again?</p>

<p align="left">I love you. A lot. I'm really glad we're friends.</p>

<p align="right">OH. Oh. Yeah. Yeah! [clears throat] Yeah. You too. Er, me too. You, you know what I mean.</p>

<p align="left">[laughs, then yawns]</p>

<p align="right">Nooo, don't... [yawns] do that... fuck, Luxy, don't you know yawns are contagious?</p>

<p align="left">[laughs again] My bad.</p>

<p align="right">Bed time for baby?</p>

<p align="left">You tell me, you're the baby.</p>

<p align="right">YOU are the baby.</p>

<p align="left">No--</p>

<p align="right">Yes, I am going to sleep. My big emotional cry took a lot out of me.</p>

<p align="left">One last question.</p>

<p align="right">Ugh, fiiiiine.</p>

<p align="left">Do you have any stuffed animals?</p>

<p align="right">What? No!</p>

<p align="left">What!!!!</p>

<p align="right">Do you have any?</p>

<p align="left">Yes, duh!!!</p>

<p align="right">This proves my point that you are a BABY!!!</p>

<p align="left">You know what? I'm going to give the pizza girl one of my stuffed animals to give you. And you better treat her well.</p>

<p align="right">Why???</p>

<p align="left">Cause at some point I'm gonna want her back!!!</p>

<p align="right">No, WHY are you giving it to me???</p>

<p align="left">Because it's the closest thing I can do to hugging you when you feel down! Just give her a squeeze and know that I care about you.</p>

<p align="right">...Lux.</p>

<p align="left">What?</p>

<p align="right">You're... super gay.</p>

<p align="left">OKAY, BUT--</p>

<p align="right">G'night, Luxy-loo. Thank you. [click]</p>
