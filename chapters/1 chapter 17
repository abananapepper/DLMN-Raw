<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>It's okay! It worked out well, actually.</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>I had plans that fell through so today was perfect!</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>So who is it I'm spying on for you?</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>ok i wouldnt call it SPYING</span><br />
<span class="reply11"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>its more like</span><br />
<span class="reply11"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>keeping track of</span><br />
<span class="reply11"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>in case things go bad</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>I would call it spying!</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>So would Master Yasuo.</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>master yasuo and me dont see eye 2 eye on a lot of things</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>Yep, he confirmed that from his side, too.</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>But that's okay, it means you probably learn a lot from each other.</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>u could say that</span><br />
<span class="reply11"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>anywho ur lookin for a pink-haired girl named lux</span><br />
<span class="reply11"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>from what she told me shes goin to lunch w this guy</span><br />
<span class="reply11"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>at some stupid cafe near the center of town</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>Do you have a picture of her?</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>o yea hang on</span><br />
<span class="pic1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b>Img desc: a screenshot of Lux's social media profile</span></span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>Huh.</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>Not what I expected!</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>what were u expecting??</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>Hmm. Something closer to an e-girl I guess!</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>WHAT</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>I didn't know you too well in the guild, but it seemed to me that e-girls were more your type!</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>WHAT ARE U ON?????????</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>Hahaha! Well, at least I know who to look for now.</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>I'll let you know once I'm closer to the center of town!</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>ty bud</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>Okay! I'm in position!</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>They're sitting at a patio table.</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>She's much cuter in person, but does look exactly like the picture you sent.</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>no duh</span><br />
<span class="reply11"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>what about him, what does he look like</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>I can't see too well from where I am - I'm at a table diagonal to theirs facing her, so I can't see his face.</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>He's tall, though. Broad shoulders. Dark hair. Strong nose.</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>ugh</span><br />
<span class="reply11"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>very "demacian handsome"</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>Probably. I guess I wouldn't really know?</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>tell me whats going on</span><br />
<span class="reply11"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>knowing kaze this probably isnt ur first rodeo</span><br />
<span class="reply11"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>so tell me like ud tell him</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>Kaze?</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>OH, Master Yasuo. I forget you guys use in-game names.</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>If you want info the way he asks for it, you two aren't as different as he made it sound.</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>oh we're v much alike which is why we hate each other</span><br />
<span class="reply11"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>but also we're friends and theres nothin either one of us can do abt it</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>I'd love to pick your brain about him, honestly.</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>He's kind of guarded.</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>hes gay</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>I know. I don't mean it like that.</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>I mean I don't know much about him beyond his outward persona.</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>Which is different than his stage persona, actually. So I guess I know more than your average bird.</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>snitches get stitches</span><br />
<span class="reply11"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>back to the matter at hand pls</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>Right! Sorry.</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>Right now she's doing most of the talking. He's paying attention though, it's not like she's just filling the space while he's on his phone.</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>Actually, I think he's asking questions to stay engaged with whatever she's talking about.</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>ur not close enough to hear?</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>I had to pick a seat with visual on her or a seat where I could hear them.</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>what kind of shitty cafe is this!!!!</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>A busy one!</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>That says a good amount about his personality, too, actually.</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>It's a well-known place, they picked a patio seat with plenty of people. She has an easy exit should she feel she needs it, and there are plenty of people around as witnesses if she doesn't feel safe.</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>or he wanted 2 show her off to the world</span><br />
<span class="reply11"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>nd make him look better for goin out w someone as pretty as her</span><br />
<span class="reply11"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>AND the witnesses work both ways if he makes her uncomfortable she cant cause a scene bc theyre in public nd she has her families image 2 worry abt</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>You're right, but I think you're also wrong.</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>His posture is relaxed, but attentive. His hands are on the table, but well outside her personal bubble.</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>how many times has kaze had u spy on ppl for him</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>None recently, but more frequently in the past.</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>I'm good, right? :D</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>yes. its annoying.</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>"Don't look for information you're not prepared to know."</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>UCK he used 2 say the SAME thing 2 me</span><br />
<span class="reply11"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>have they ordered</span><br />
<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>Um... it looks like yes, but they only have drinks right now.</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>His drink isn't in my line of sight, but she has what looks like an iced coffee?</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>LOL</span><br />

<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>It was a... "medium" laugh.</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>Not loud-loud, but loud enough for me to hear.</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>Not a polite giggle or anything.</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>fuck.</span><br />

<span class="text1"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>You don't sound like you have a lot of faith in her!</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>If she's really everything you think of her, is she really the kind of person to jump straight into a relationship after one date?</span><br />
<span class="reply1"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>uve got it backward</span><br />
<span class="reply11"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx</b></span>i have no faith in MYSELF to win her from this guy</span><br />

<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>She's asking questions now, I think.</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>She's nodding along as he's talking.</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>And... she's smiling.</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>It's this radiant smile that lights up her whole face.</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>She's looked kind of... mildly stressed this whole time.</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>Background stressed, if that makes sense. Like something outside of the moment she's in is bothering her.</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>I didn't notice til now, because it's completely gone now.</span><br />
<span class="text11"><span class="hide"><b>Taliyah</b></span>She's here, just here. And she's happy.</span><br />
