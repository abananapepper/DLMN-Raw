<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I didn't mean it like that. I just don't think I've known anyone from Zaun. Piltover, yes, but not Zaun.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>well, cause piltover is for the richies</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>zaun is for the poor and morally dubious</span><br />

<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>What brought you to Piltover?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>idk actually!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I think maybe at first it was that I was drawn to how similar but different it was to zaun</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>its still like, tinkery, but its a lot more orderly in most ways</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>and I HATED THAT!!!!!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I hated it so much that I was drawn to it</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>so I've kind of been staying in piltover ever since</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>sometimes I go other places but piltover has become like, my home i guess</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You hated it... so you stayed?</span><br />

<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Yes? I have a lot of cute notebooks that I dont use for a lot so I started writing down questions in one of them.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>that's adorable</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Oh, hush. Anyway, I found it. Next up is, why did you choose the name Jinx?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>oh god this is a weird story buckle up</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>so like, I don't remember my given name. there's a whole sob story behind that but ehhhhhhhhhh.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>chalk it up to, theres a lot of punk-ass kids who get adopted by the streets in zaun. </span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>so like, no name? no problem! kids called me x, like my name was scratched out</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Like the code name you told me to use</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>OH YEAH! I forgot about that</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but yeah so my name was x, but that was back in zaun</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>when I came up to piltover, I... caused... a bit of a stir.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Care to elaborate? :P</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>promise your well-to-do self wont think less of me</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Oh come on, Jinx!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you gotta promise</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Fine, I promise.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I did some crimes.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Just like mayhem chaos crimes though!!!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>just to kind of tip the scales on this perfect town and its perfect people and their perfect clockwork</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>and i didn't get anyone else involved, i made my own gadgets and everything</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>....Did anyone get hurt?</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>....Jinx?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>ok yes people got hurt!!! thats probably something i should feel worse about than I do!!!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>You don't feel bad?!</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i mean i do NOW, but i didn't at the time and didn't for a long time, and i'm definitely not losing sleep over it</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>no one DIED or anything</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but i'm not gonna play it off like it was harmless pranks, yeah, people got hurt</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>ANYWAY the people in piltover started calling me a curse or a jinx, and i liked that name so I kept it</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you promised</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I know. I'm just... let me process this.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>look, it's not something I'm PROUD of</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i WAS at the time</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but i like. recently grew a conscience.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Recently.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>yeah I'm pretty sure I told you you're the first person who makes me question how my actions effect others!!!</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>So like, you've only thought about this in the past few days?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Maybe??? I don't know??? It was probably something that bugged me before but I like bottled up???</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>Look okay when I try to think about it my brain like... ties itself in knots</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>my mind just goes in circles and I can't figure out how i actually feel about and how i SHOULD feel</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>part of me would be proud of it like it was an achievement, but part of me is like... no you cant feel that way thats bad</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i don't know where one ends and one begins and when all this started</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>it's all fucked up</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I'M all fucked up</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Okay, stop.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>sorry</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i didnt mean to unload all of that and like. guilt you about it</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>No no no, stop. Stop. Stop typing.</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Good. Now listen to me. I am not equipped to help you unpack all of this. And honestly, I'm kind of freaked out about it. But I did promise, and I know the version of yourself that you've presented to me is someone I care about. I don't know if that's the true version of yourself, and that's something I'm going to have to grapple with a bit. I don't... I don't want to freak out on you or anything, but this is also a lot to take in, so I'm trying to stay calm about it. I'm not willing to throw our friendship away over this but it's... it's a lot, you know?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>yeah</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>I'm kind of like</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>torn about this whole thing i guess</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i'm sad that like... you know, i guess, and that its a Thing</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but also it's not something i felt like i had to keep from you</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>No, I'm glad I know, and that you told me. I'm glad you didn't keep it a secret or anything.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>i don't need to keep secrets from you</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>And I... appreciate that. Greatly.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>don't mention it</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I have to go take care of some things. I'll keep adding to my list, but is it okay if we postpone for now?</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>oh yeah of course</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Thanks. I'll talk to you later, okay? I promise</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you don't have to</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>promise, I mean</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>you don't have to talk to me again either</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>but that would suck</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>and I'd miss you</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>Honestly, I'd miss you too much too. And you've helped me too much for you to be a bad person.</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>oh no no no I AM a bad person</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>don't get it twisted, I am a bad person</span><br />
<span class="text"><span class="hide"><b>Lux:</b></span>I think maybe you're just a person who is capable of doing bad things, like most everyone. Now I really really need to scoot, I'm sorry, I'd keep talking with you now if I could. I WILL talk to you later. Because I want to. </span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>okay</span><br />
<span class="breply"><span class="hide"><b>Jinx:</b></span>thank you</span><br />
