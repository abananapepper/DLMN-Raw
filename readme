Hi! Thanks for translating Don't Lose My Number <3 I will put all the raw code here, as well as the work skin code AND instructions on how to use those codes just in case I update the main fic and forget to post the update here for a few days.
Sometimes code will be added or changed as the fic progresses - at the start of a new chapter code, I will put a note to re-copy all of the Work Skin file into your work skin file so that nothing breaks!
Workskin codes and raw HTML codes (without chapter content) will be found in "Codes". Chapters will be found in "Fic Content."
