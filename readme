Hi! Thanks for translating Don't Lose My Number <3 I will put all the raw code here for you to copy and paste, as well as a direct copy of the codes per chapter. Most days I will update the chapter files the same day I update the fic.
Sometimes code will be added or changed as the fic progresses - at the start of a new chapter code, I will put a note to re-copy all of the Work Skin file into your work skin file so that nothing breaks!
Workskin codes will be found in "Codes". Chapters will be found in "Fic Content."
